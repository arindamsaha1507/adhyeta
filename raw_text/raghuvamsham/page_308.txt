"(10)
external source: for Manu's descendants were ever protected by
their own valour.
5. By (giving her) savoury mouthfuls of grass, by scratchings,
by keeping off flies, and by uuobstructed rovings at will, thus
did the supreme monarch become diligently engaged in her pro-
pitiation.
6. The lord of the earth followed her like a shadow-standing'
still whenever she stopped, proceeding on when she went on,
patiently sitting down when she sat down, and drinking water
when she drank it.
7. Possessing kingly fortune (or royalty) which, with its
insignia cast aside, could be inferred from the super-eminence
of majesty, he resembled a royal elephant, inwardly.in condition
of rut but without the lines of ichor manifested externally.
8. Marked with hair tied up with the tendrils of creepers, he,
with his bow strung, wandered in the wood, as if wishing to
discipline the ferocious beasts of the forest, under the pretext of
guarding the sacrificial cow of the sage.
9. The trees on either side of the king, mighty like the god
with the noose (Varuņa), (as he passed on) unattended by
servants, uttered, as it were, the exclamations of "Victory to the
king; here he comes," by means of the notes of impassioned birds.
10. On him, bright as fire and worthy of adoration, the young
creepers, agitated (urged) by the wind, showered their flowers, as
he passed by their side, as the maidens of the city (lit. the
daughters of citizens) would the customary la'ja's (fried paddy):
11. The female deer, gazing on his person declared to be full of
feelings, tender with compassion, by their hearts remaining unaffe-
cted with fear though he wielded a bow, obtained the fruit of the
great expanse of their eyes.
12. He heard (as he went on) his own lofty glory, loudly
carolled from the bowers by the sylvan nymphs, in a manner in.
which the purpose of (the accompaniment of the music of) flutes -
was served by singing bamboos, having their holes filled with
wind.
13. The wind charged with the spray of the mountain streams,
and bearing the fragrance of the gently shaken flowers of the trees,
served (refreshed) him, who, purified by his righteous conduct, was
oppressed by heat as he had no umbrella with him."
