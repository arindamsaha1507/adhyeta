Ś1. 64. a &c.-This indicates that they did not wish to
continue the fight.
:-approached him as their protector.
A Sanskrit idiom which means 'sought his protection.' -Seo Sanj.
Or we may take it 3-certainly', and construe ggfæði á‹¥TE
प्रणिपातप्रतिकारो हि । महात्मनाम्-bore आत्मन् may mean 'soul', high-soul-
ed men; or 'effort', men of mighty efforts. It is impossible to resist
such men, and therefore submission is the safest course. Cf. '
यत्नो धृतिर्बुद्धिः स्वभावो ब्रह्म वर्ष्म च ' Amara.
Ś1. 65. — with fa is A`tm. when its object is in the
body of the agent and not a part of the body, by the rule &c.
Pân. I. 3. 37. See Sanj. Thus here being in the body of the afor
agent, and not a part of his body, we get f. For farther discus-
sion of this point see Sid -Kau. on the Sâtra. sifatzary-Híàg
रत्नानि अजिनरत्नानि best kinds of skins. Cf. जानी जाती यदुत्कृष्टं तद्रत्नमिति
कथ्यते। वलय – वलं यातीति वलयः & circle; a bower of. The regions to
the North-west of India are still known for their luscious grapes
and other fruits. कुत्रचित् 'वलजभूमिषु इति पाठः । तत्र वलजं क्षेत्रम् | वलजे
क्षेत्र पूरे इत्यमरः | Ohār.
Śl. 66. In this sl. Raghu is compared to the sun, his arms to
the solar rays, and the kings he dethroned to the moisture sucked up
by the rays of the sun. f(the quarter) presided over by
Kubera, i. e. the north.
: car sifafarga: The rays of the
sun are compared to the bright arrows shot by Raghu in a battle.
This indicates the agility with which Raghu discharged his arrows,
as well as their immensity. By this the poet refers to the
whole tract including the north-west, the north and the north-east.
--The idea of lifting up is involved in both the instances.
It is supposed that in the summer solstice () the sun goes
towards the north to dry up moisture with his rays, and in the winter
solstice () he goes towards the south in order to pour the
absorbed moisture in the form of rain. Cf. śl. 39.
Ś1. 67. अध्वनमः -- अध्वनोऽध्वजो वा श्रमः । सिन्धु -- This may not
necessarily be the Indus, but some river in Kashmere, as remarked
by Malli. Châr. reads for fy (while Sum. reads) and
remarks that it is a pond in the country of Kâs'mere, which is
a mere guess. This has been conclusively proved to be the Oxus
by Prof. Pathak (see Ind. Ant. Nov. 1912, p. 266) and is probably
the older reading.
