[Canto II-
That he
S'1. 64. aaruf-This opithet is used for the sake of effect.
The king who always granted the wishes of suitors was now a
-suitor himself.
&c.-Dilipa had earned for himself the
title of 'hero' in all its aspects by the power of his arms.
W898 युद्धवीर, दानवीर and धर्मवीर is described in the first Canto. And
here be proves himself to be a दयावीर also like जीमूतवाहन. सुदक्षिणा.
याम् - Su. being the आधार of the जन्मक्रिया of tho child is put in the
Loc. case. तनयम् - तनोति वंशमिति तनयः ।
-The
S'. 65.
Upa. Tat. Comp.; see Sanj.
Dat. by the rule प्रत्याङ्ग्भ्यां भुवः पूर्वस्थ कर्ता | In the case of भु with प्रति
or 3 meaning to 'promise,' the person to whom some thing is
promised, after request, is put in the Dat. case. &c.-The
cow wished to impart a peculiar efficacy to her milk which would
undo the effect of the curse of her mother and remove the child-
lessness of the king. The king was f and had not tasted her
milk as yot.
S/1. 66. वंत्सस्य - This means by लक्षणा, वत्सपीतस्य । अनुज्ञामधिगम्य-
This is necessary as the sage had desired him to live on the products
of the forest alone. 3-milk; lit. that produced in the udder
()
&c.-According to Manu, a sixth of the produce
of the earth was due to the king from his subjects. See ft.-note;
and cf. V. 8. The cow is here again compared to the earth; see II. 3.
Here Châr. notices a different reading, viz, arafıágíðíîæ¶zz….. |
- स्तन्यं रसं वश्मि तवोपभोक्तुं षष्ठांशं &c. and remarks –रसस्य नपुंसकत्वा
भावान्मत्वर्थीयकल्पनं वा । Nandargikar,
S1. 67. क्षितीशेन - क्षियन्ति निवसन्ति प्राणिनोऽस्यामिति क्षितिस्तस्या ईशः ।
The force of the epithet is this:-Dilipa was a king and so could
have done any thing he liked. Yet he awaited the order of the sage
to drink the cow's milk. This humility in the king pleased the cow.
fa:-The reference to Vasishtha here is not out of place.
Though the king was ordered to drink the milk there and then, he
declined to do so. And yet the cow was not offended. This was
because Dilipa wished to take the permission of Vasishtha, her
revered naster. -shows that the two actions expressed by
प्रीततरा बभूव and प्रत्याययौ took place simultaneously. अश्रमेण – because
both of them were in a pleased mood, and so did not feel the
fatigue of the journey.
S'1. 68.
gg:-Ero this Dilipa's face was overspread with
a sort of gloom caused by his childless state. It now wore away"
