It was not because Ráma thought her guilty, but because he wanted
not even a breath of criticism against him among his subjects. As
& King he felt it was his duty to lay down an example of rigid
moral purity, and to show that all his acts were above suspicion.
Râma's killing of Sambûka is then related, which too was an act
done with the intention of regulating the conduct of his subjects
as a whole, and not of punishing Sambûka individually; for after all
Sambûka did go to heaven as he wished (XV. 53). We thus
realize how Ráma has been portrayed particularly as a sovereign
who is most anxious to rule his people with scrupulous punctilious-
following in his own person whatever he wanted his people
to follow, even when it entailed suffering on himself. No kingly
ideal of later times can enjoin a better precept or point to a
worthier model; and it is but fitting in the nature of things that
Rama-Rajyz should become in popular parlance a common expression
for the ideal Government, where the interests of the people are
placed first, even before those of the sovereign.

(5) THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE POEM.
Besides the Meghadûta, the Raghuvamsa is the only work of
Kâlidâsa which contains a number of references to the geography
of India as it was known to him in those days. These are to be
found in the 4th, 6th and 13th cantos, but more particularly in
the 4th, which describes the dig-vijaya of Raghu. The student can
easily identify these places on the map26 which is reproduced
elsewhere, and the detailed explanations would be found in our
Notes. He should especially trace the course of Raghu's tour of
conquest. Starting from Ayodhyá, Raghu first marches towards
the East, where he conquers the Suhmas and the Vangas. He
then crosses the river Kapiśâ, which takes him to the South.
Here he conquers, in order, the Utkalas, the Kalingas, the Pândyas,
the Keralas, and the Aparântas on the western coast. In the
West and in the north-west he subdues the Pârasîkas, the Hânas
and the Kambojas; and in the North and the north-east, the
Utsavasamketas,: the Prâgjyotishas, and the Kâmarûpas, returning
thence to his capital. Most of the principal rivers and mountains
have been mentioned here; e.g. the Sahya and Himalaya ranges,
26 We are greatly indebted to the Map given in Pandit R.
Krishnamachariar's Raghuvams'avimars'a (1908), from which we have
borrowed some of these identifications."
