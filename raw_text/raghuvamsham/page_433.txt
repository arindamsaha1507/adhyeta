"Canto II. ]
( 49 )
-Ancient warriors
in the sense of immediate futurity.
used to furnish the hafts of their arrows with heron's feathers to
regulate their motion.
this goes with gà; the hånd
remained stuck to the haft of the arrow; but then the two words
should have been compounded •ġ¶¶ïïí:; since they are not, it
is a case of rèíî ç¶sara¶ra:. Some propose the construction
करः सक्ताङ्गुलिः सन् सायकपुंखे एव अवतस्थे. But in this case the आकांक्षा of
still remains :-where was it stuck?
&c.-Here
means an action (ƒ¾¶); cf. I. 15; Megh. I. 55. The hand of Dilipa,
involuntarily stuck to the root of the arrow, looked like a painted
hand in the act of drawing out an arrow. अवतस्थे –स्था is Atm.
when preceded by सम्, अव, प and वि ( समवप्रविभ्यः स्थ: Pán. I. 3. 23 ).
S'1. 32. 3. p. p. of with ; the other form is
(distressed). Malli. takes it as an indec. (3); it
may be taken as an adj. meaning 'standing near,' qualifying KÍ.
आगस्कृत्-आगः कृतवानित्यागस्कृत् ; सहसा एति इति आग: crime, sin, fr. इ to
go and the Unâdi aff. अस्. स्वतेजोभिः - तेजस् is that inborn spirit
or sense of self-respect which does not allow one to put up with an
insult at any cost; see ft.-note.
the hood (or, body )
of a serpent,+
&c. It is a well-
known fact, at least in India, that the cobra is reduced to a helpless
condition, being made a prisoner within a charmed circle, by serpent-
charmers by means of spells and the roots of herbs. Cfl-

one having.'
1.3.
-a partisan of the good, i. e, one who always
stands by the good, (such as Vasishtha's cow in the present instance).
See Sanj. and ft.-note. Cf. qu. açinħgy—Þg is properly
flag, and since a flag prominently attracts attention and is the mos
important factor in an army, it means 'the most prominent or chief
thing in a class.'
विस्माययन् - Pro.
P. of the Cau. of स्मि. On the reading विस्मापयन्
Malli, remarks as follows:-With the reading far we have only
the coming in; but this may be questioned.
Tor
For when we change
to F by the rule ¶¶, Pâṇ. VI. 1. 57, the wonder is under_
stood to be due to the (causative agent) and not to a
instrument. But by the rule 'fùù' Pâṇ. 1. 3. 68, we must
have the A'tm. and the reading becomes : Therefore, taking
मनुष्यवाकू as the करण of the विस्मय we get विस्माययन्. See Sanj. and
ft.-notes. Bhaṭṭoji Dikshita also thinks that
is the poet's
