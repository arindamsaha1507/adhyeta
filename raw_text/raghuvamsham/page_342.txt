[Canto VI.
the high road between the rows of platforms, seated in a
quadrangular conveyance carried by men, and beautiful by her
train of attendants.
11. The kings fell down by their hearts on ( had their hearts
at once drawn to) that supremely exquisite creation of the
Creator, in the form of the damsel, the cynosure of hundreds of
eyes; their bodies alone remained on their seats.
12. Various were the amatory gestures, the first messengers of

as red as a lotus, and bore linear marks of bauners.
19. Some one put one of his hands, the lustre of the diamonds
shooting through the finger chinks, on his crown, as if the latter had
slipped from its proper place, although it was in its right position.
