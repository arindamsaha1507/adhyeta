composed before A. D. 413, that is to say, while Chandragupta II.
was on the throne; but I am inclined to regard the reign of
Kumâragupta I. (413-455) as the time during which the poet's
later works were composed, and it seems possible, that the whole
of his literary career fell within the limits of that reign. It is
also possible that he may have continued writing after the
accession of Skandagupta". Mr. Smith thus makes Kâlidâsa's-
literary career extend over a period of not less than thirty years.
Note that, even according to Mr. Smith, there is nothing wrong
in the tradition about a Vikramáditya having been our poe: 's.
patron; only we must arrive at an understanding as to which
Vikramaditya is meant, because various kings in the history of
ancient India called themselves by that title.
We ourselves hold,
for reasons given below, that we must accept as our poet's patron
that king Vikramaditya whose traditional era commences at 56
B. C. The attempt to place Kalidāsa in the court of the Gupta
kings rests merely on the fact that Chandragupta II. was named
Vikramaditya. But the existence of prior kings of that title is
now a certainty.17
Vatsabhúti, the author of the Mandasor inscription, copies
several ideas from Kālidâsa; the latter must, therefore, have lived
prior to 472 A. D. Again, Asvaghosha, the author of a life of the
great Buddha in Sanskrit, has numerous passages similar to those
occurring in the works of Kâlidâsa. Now, Kâlidâsa was an original
poet borrowing his subjects from Válmîki and other ancient authors;
Asvaghosha was more a philosopher than a poet, and may, with
greater probability, be supposed to have borrowed his ideas from
Kalidasa. The date of Asvaghosha is given as 78 A. D.; and if
we suppose him to have borrowed from Kâlidâsa, the latter will
have to be placed earlier than 78 A. D. And in this view Dr..
Peterson also concurs when he says Kálidâsa stands near the
beginning of the Christian era, if, indeed, he does not overtop it.'
law of
There is also internal evidence pointing to the same conclusion.
We have first the evidence obtained from the state of
inheritance and the penalty for theft as they are indicated in
passages in the Sakuntala. The passage in the sixth Act of the
drama, announoing the death of the merchant Dhanamitra who died
17 The Râjataramginî mentions an earlier Vikramâditya, a con-
temporary of Pratâpâditya of Kashmir."
