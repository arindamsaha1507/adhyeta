S1. 75. ग्रैवेय - मीत्रासु भवानि स्थितानि चैवेयाणि; see supra s1. 48.
औषधयः -- The other form is औषधि. नक्तम् - at night. अस्नेहीपिका:--
न विद्यते स्नेहः यास ता अस्नेहाः; दीपयन्तीति दीपिकाः; अस्नेहाश्व ता दीपिका
f: lamps requiring no oil. The mountain Himalaya is said
to have on it potent herbs endowed with the power of emitting
light at night. See Kum. I. 10. The herbs here served as watch-
fires to Raghu's soldiers.
S/1. 76. तस्योत्सृष्टनिवासेषु - The presence of the word उत्सृष्ट shows
that even the hardy and ferocious Kiråtas had fled away through
fear when Raghu approached them. They ventured forth from
their lurking places only when they found that Raghu had left. Since

किरातेभ्यः – The word is derived as किरं पर्यन्तभूमिमतति गच्छतीति किरात

पर्यन्ताश्रयाभिर्निजस्य सदृशं नाम्नः किरातैः कृतम् | Rat. II. 3. The Kiratas
are hillmen living by hunting and clad in a dress made of peacock's
feathers. See Kum. I. 6, 15. In the Purâņas they are mentioned
along with Mlechchhas, and are described to be of a dark complexion,
dwarfish in stature, with short arms and legs, projecting chin, broad,
flat nose, red eyes and tawny hair. In the Sab. Par, of the Mah.
Bhâr. (XXX. 15), Bhîma is said to have conquered seven Kirâta
chiefs from Videha which included Darabhangá and part of Eastern
Nepâl. In another passage they are said to be ferocious bow-men clad
in hides and living upon fruits and roots. The Kirátas therefore seem
to be a tribe of mountaineers inhabiting the sub-Himalayan regions.

the north-east region of Ladak which is watered by the Kooner, and
which is said to be the mythological abode of the Kimpurushas, the
Kinaras and other semi-divine beings. According to the Maha-
