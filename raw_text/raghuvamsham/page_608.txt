[ Canto IX.
Bhár. When Indra conquered the asuras there was only one.
called Namuchi who strongly resisted and captured him. He
offered to let Indra go provided he promised not to kill him by
day or by night, with wet or with dry.' Indra promised to do
30 and was released, but he cut off Namuchi's head at twilight and
with the foam of water ( which was according to the authorities.
neither wet nor dry). The Mah. Bhár. adds that the severed
head followed Indra crying out O wicked slayer of thy friend."
According to another version, Namuchi was a friend of Indra and
once drank up his strength and made him quite imbecile. The
As'vins, (and Sarasvati also as the story goes) then supplied
Indra with a rajra with which he cut off the demon's head.

see note on raià: II. 8. The flowers are a characteristic
mark of the vernal season whence it is called gs: (Vik. I. 8).
The season brought with it the flowers, intentionally as
it were,.
in order to do homage to the king. See сom.
the king deserved such a tribute of respect at the hands of the
season. The king possessed the four characteristics of the four
deities; he had the impartiality of Yama, the liberality of Kubers,
the power to chastise the wicked like Varnns, and supreme power
like that of Indra. See com
graceful, esteemed,.
for his prowess was always distinguished by acts of humanity.
and a due regard to the rights of others.

by Pan. III. 2. 61. refers to the beginning of the
summer solstice during which the sun, in its apparent annual re-
volution, appears to go more and more to the north, and cold
gradually diminishes. The same description occurs in Kum,

$1. 26. &c.-This is not the absolute order in nature;
it is so given here because the majority of plants put forth flowers
early in spring. The poet does not speak with reference to the same
plant or tree putting forth first flowers and then leaves. See Malli.
-This cannot be taken as a Gen. Tat, (see Pån. II. 2. 11);
should therefore be treated as a Karmapravachaniya, as Malli.
