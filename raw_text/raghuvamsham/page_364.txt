[ Canto VIII.
55. This face of yours with the hair waving and with the
speech completely stopped pains me (causes distress) like a single
lotus closed at night and having the humming of the bees in the
interior suspended.
56. The night comes back again to the moon, and its mate to
the bird that moves about in pair (the Chakraváka); they are here -
fore able to endure the period (duration) of separation. But how
will you, who have gone never to return, not burn (pain) me?
57. O lady with beautiful thighs, tell (me), how that delicate
body of yours, which would be pained even when placed on a bed
of tender sprouts, will bear ascending the funeral pyre.
58. This girdle, your first companion in private, which is
(now) noiseless on account of the cessation of your sporting gait,
does not appear not to have followed, through grief, you who are
sleeping not to awake again.
59-60. It is true that although you were desirous of (going to)
heaven, you kept here, out of regard for me, sweet voice in the
cuckoos, the gait slow through intoxication in the female swans,
tremulous (sprightly) glances in the deer, and amorous sports in
the creepers shaken by the wind; but they are not able to support
(i.e. soothe) my heart which is heavily grieved (lit. whose
torment is great) at your separation.
61. The mango-tree and the Priyangu creeper were, O dear
one, fixed upon by you for (or intended as) a couple. It is then
improper for you to go without having celebrated their marriage-
ceremony.
62. How shall I use for the funeral offering the flowers (lit.
make a garland of the flowers to be used at the funeral) which
this As'oka tree, whose longing was gratified by you, would put
forth and which would have been (were you living) an ornament
for your hair?
63. O lady of fair form, you are mourned by this As'oka
tree shedding tears in the form of flowers as if remembering the
tavour of (the touch) of your foot (no more to be got), in which
the anklet was jingling and which was difficult to be obtained
by any one else.
64. Ohlady of Kinnara-like voice, why have you slept without
finishing the pleasure-girdle half wreathed (by you) in my com-
pany with Bakula flowers imitating your breath (in point of irag-
rance)?"
