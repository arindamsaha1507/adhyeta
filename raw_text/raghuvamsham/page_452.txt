The river Sarasvatî flows near Thâneshvara (F). Its
modern name is Sarasvatî or Caggar. Anandoram Borooah says-
'Two other junctions are mentioned which are borne out by the map,
viz. of the Kaus'ikî and the Drishadvatî on the west and of the
Aruns with the Sarasvatî below Thâneshvara. Near the first is
Vyasasthall, the modern Basthali. Not far from the junctions of
the two combined streams (Sarasvatî and Drishadvatî) is the
modern Kaithal, which is probably Kapisthala of the Vanaparvan.
The Sarasvatî which loses itself in the sandy desert is supposed by
the poets to flow under the surface of the earth, and join ultimately
the ocean.' The Rigveda represents it as flowing into the sea. But
later legends make it disappear under ground aud join the Ganga and
Yamuna at Prayâga. Pilgrims yet speak of a river in Bihar having a
dry bed but giving water within a few inches of its sandy surface,
which they call Falgu-Ganga and consider almost as sacred as Gangâ
itself. The Mah.-Bhâr. thus accounts for its disappearance:-Varuņa
once carried off Bhadrâ, the beautiful spouse of a Brâhmaṇa named
, and would not yield her up. The Brahmana then addressed
himself to the countries and the river Sarasvati, saying, 'O goddess
Sarasvati, vanish into the deserts and let this land, deserted by trees,
become impure.' When the country had been thus turned into a
desert, Varuņa restored his wife to 3."
