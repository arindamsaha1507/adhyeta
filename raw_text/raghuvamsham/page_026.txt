heirless, seems to Prof. Apte to refer to a period when the widow
of a deceased person could not inherit his estate. Such a period is
to be found only before the Christian ora, when Manu, Apastamba
and Vasishtha held sway, and Brihaspati, Sankha, Likhita and
Yájñavalkya had not yet written their Codes. The penalty for
theft, as indicated in the prologue to the sixth Act, seems to have
been the extreme one, and there is also a passage of similar import
in the Vikramorvasiya (qargar &c. V. 1). The penalty
for theft has been from time to time mitigated with the progress of
civilization. Manu and Apastamba lay down the extreme penalty,
the option of fine being introduced later on, as we find it in the
Smriti of Brihaspati. These two circumstances tend to show that
Kálidasa flourished at a period which is anterior to Brihaspati, the
latter being generally placed in the first century A. D.
Prof. Apte further calls attention to the fact that there is no
reference to the Nyâya philosophy in the works of Kâlidâsa [except
perhaps in Ragh, XIII. 1, in which the word (3)
occurs, but which the poet might have borrowed from the
Sámkhyas ], and concludes that he must have lived before the
development of that philosophy. Then again we have the evidence
of style. The artificiality of diction and the fondness for long
compounds and double-meaning words which mark the writings of
Dandin (who in his Kâvyádarsa says that an abundance of com-
pounds constitutes the quality of ojas in poetry), Bâņa, Bhavabhúti
(7th century A. D.) and other medieval writers, are entirely absent
in Kâlidâsa's writings-a fact which shows that he must be placed
some six or seven centuries before them, a period necessary to cause
such a revolution in the art of literary composition, considering the
scanty means of the propagation of learning in those times. It
thus becomes clear that Kâlidâsa lived in the Erst century B. 0.

18 Prof. S. Ray refers to the discovery in 1909-10 of the Bhita
nedallion, which pictures a scene which looks exatly like the opening
scene of the S'âkuntala. The medallion is assigned to the Sunga period
(184 B. C.-72 B. C. ), and Prof. Ray assumes that Kalidasa is anterior
to the date of the medallion, though the Archeological Survey authorities,
holding to the Vincent Smith date, are inclined to dispute the identification
of the scene with the one in the Play."
