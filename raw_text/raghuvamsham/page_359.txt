"Canto VIII. ]
(61)
the Brahmanical power should be combined with the martial spi -
rit of the Kshatriya class.
5. The subjects looked upon their new sovereign as Raghu
himself restored to youth; for he not only inherited his regal for-
tune but also all his virtues.
6. Two things only, being united with two other blessed
things respectively, looked peculiarily beautiful; viz. the prosper-
ous ancestral kingdom by its union with Aja, and his youthful
age with his modest conduct.
7. He, though powerful, enjoyed (governed) the Earth, that
had recently come under his sway, with a tender heart, like a
newly wedded spouse; lest by his violence she might take fright.
8. 'I alone am the king's favourite' so thought every one of
his subjects; for no contempt was ever shown by him to any one,
as there is none shown by the sea to any one of hundreds
of rivers.
9. Neither too severe nor yet too mild, but pursuing a middle
course of policy, he made the kings bend before him without de-
throning them; just as a moderately strong gale bends down the
trees but uproots them not.
10. Now the king Raghu, finding that his son was firmly
established among his (ministers) and subjects, became indiffer-
ent to the objects of pleasure, even though situated in heaven,
which are perishable by nature.
11. For verily the descendants of Dilípa's race, when they
grew old, transferred the royal fortune to their accomplished sons,
and curbing their passions, betook themselves to the life of an-
chorites, wearing garments of the bark of trees.
12. The son (Aja) with his head adorned with the royal turban,
prostrated at the feet of his father who was about to repair to the
forest, and begged that he should not be abandoned.
13. Raghu, who tenderly loved his son, granted that desire of
him whose face was covered with tears, but did not resume his
kingly fortune, once abandoned, just as a serpent does not put on
the slough it has once cast off.
14. He, having entered the last stage of life, lived, it is said,
in a convent outside the city, where he was served, his senses not
being affected, by the goddess of the royal fortune, as by a
daughter-in-law, enjoyable only by his son."
