III. THE POEM.
(1)
SUMMARY OF THE STORY.
Before the student proceeds to a detailed study of his actual
text, it is advisable that he should make himself familiar with the
contents of the poem as a connected whole. We, therefore, give
below briefly the story of the Raghuvamsa as presented in its
nineteen Cantos :-
OANTO I. After saluting Siva and Párvatî, the poet eulogizes
the virtues of the kings of the race of Raghu, whose history he
proposes to describe. The royal line of the Raghus originally
sprang from the Sun, whose son, Manu, was the first king in this
race. In direct descent from Manu came the supremely eminent
King Dilîpa, with whose history the poem properly begins. Dilipa
is an ideal king, being a most efficient, benign and virtuous ruler.
He has a queen called Sudakshina, the very type of courtesy and
kindliness, and the only thing that mars their happiness is
that they have no issue. In course of time Dilipa deoides to
consult his family-priest, Vasishtha, as to what holy rites &c.
he might perform that would bless him with a son and heir.
Leaving the government of his kingdom to his ministers, Dilipa
starts for Vasishtha's hermitage in the company of his wife. In
the evening they reach their destination and make known their
wishes to the preceptor. Vasishtha explains that a curse, formerly
pronounced upon the King by the divine cow Surabhi, but unknown
to him, was the bar in the way, and for that purpose he should have
to propitiate Surabhi's daughter, Nandinî, who was his (Vasishtha's)
own cow. If she were pleased, she could grant that wish of his.
Vasishtha then explains to the royal pair how to serve the cow;
after which they retire for the night.
CANTO II. The next morning Dilipa begins the daily routine
of disciplined service of the cow, Nandinî. He regularly accom-
panies her every morning, after she was worshipped, to the forest
and back again to the hermitage in the evening when she returned
from the pasturage. Twenty-one days thus pass away. On the
22nd day, the cow, wishing to test the devotion of her follower,
enters a cave of the Himalayas, overgrown with grass, for grazing.
As the King's eyes are riveted on the mountain scenery, she
creates an illusory lion pouncing upon her. The King's attention
is suddenly called back by Nandini's cry; and what does he see!
