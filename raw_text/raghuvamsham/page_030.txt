accordingly. On his way he happens to kill a wild elephant, who
turns out to be a Gandharva born in that form owing to a curso.
The Gandharva gives to Aja a certain miraculous weapon (astra)
called Sammohana. On reaching Bhoja's city, Aja rests for the
night, and in the next morning goes to the hall where the
Svayamvara ceremony was to be held.
CANTO VI. There he takes his seat in the
numerous other kings who had come from far and
assembly of
near for the
vayamvara ceremony. The Princess Indumati enters, accom-
panied by her clever maid Sunandá, who takes her in turn to
each one of the royal suitors and describes him and his qualifica-
tions in a few well-chosen words. The Princess passes by them all,
including among them the rulers of Magadha, Anga, Avantî,
Anûpa, Sûrasena, Kalinga and Pândya. Finally she comes to
Aja, whom she chooses as her husband, to the deep chagrin of
the other kings who feel envious and humiliated.
CANTO VII. The actual wedding-ceremony of Aja and
Indumatî then takes place in the royal palace, after which all depart
for their respective countries. The slighted kings, however, bear
a grudge against Aja, and they, therefore, waylay his party on his
way back to Ayodhyá. A very fierce fight ensues. Aja entrusts
his bride to the care of his minister, and personally takes an active
part in the slaughter of his foes, whom he completely vanquishes
by means of the
miraculous Sammohana' astra, which the
Gandharva had given him before.
He then returns to the capital;
and his father entrusts the kingdom to his care, wishing to live
in retirement.
CANTO VIII. Aja begins to reign, and Raghu continues to
live near by, in secluded retirement, when after a few years he
departs this life. Aja gives him a suitable funeral. In course of
time Indumatî gives birth to a son who is named Dasaratha. Aja
pleases all by his excellent rule. A change comes over his happy
life when once, while he and his royal consort were sporting in a
pleasure-garden, a wreath of flowers falls from the sky below upon
Indumuti who instantly drops down dead. The grief of the
King at this unexpected stroke of misfortune knows no bounds.
After the funeral was over, as Aja still remained plunged in sorrow
and took no interest in life, his preceptor Vasishtha sent to him a
disciple with a message to cheer him. It was explained to Aja
how his wife had formerly been a celestial nymph (apsaras) who"
