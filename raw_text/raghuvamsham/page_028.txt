him. Instantly the King's hand passes to the arrow-case, but
just as he seizes an arrow his hand remains fixed there. To add
to the wonder of the already bewildered King, the lion speaks in
human voice telling him that he was a servant of Siva, posted there
to guard the trees, with orders not to leave the place, but to live on
whatever came within his reach, and claims the cow as his rightful
prey. The King finds himself in a fix; it was his primary duty to
save the cow at any cost. What was he to do? He could not shoot
an arrow; but he could offer himself up in lieu of the cow, as they
had both entered the cave together; for Siva's order to the lion was
that he should eat whatever came within his grasp. This the magna-
nimous King does. After a long conversation with the lion he
succeeds in prevailing upon the latter to eat him up and let go
the cow. The King thus stands the test; the illusion vanishes and
instead of the terrible leap of the lion there falls on the King a
shower of flowers from heaven. The well-pleased cow confers on
the King the wished-for blessing, and they return home. The king
informs the sage and his queen of the cow's favour. Their object
being gained Vasishtha sends back the royal couple, and they enter
their capital amidst the rejoieings of the citizens. In a short time
Sudakshina shows signs of pregnancy.

performed 99 horse-sacrifices, wishes to perform the hundredtb
to complete the list. Indra, Lord of the gods, in joalousy secretly
steals the sacrificial horse to prevent the completion of the rite.
To Raghu was
entrusted the duty of guarding the horse ;
and ordinarily he would have been unable to trace the horse. But
Nandini, whose protégé he was in a way, appears on the scene and
bestows upon him superhuman sight, Raghu then sees Indra carry-
ing away the horse, and fights with him most gallantly. Indra of
course triumphs over Raghu in the end; but he is so ighly pleased
with Raghu's bravery that, although he could not restore the
horse, he promises, tobestow upon his father, Dilipa, the whole merit
obtainable from the sacrifice, had it been duly completed, as a
mark of his appreciation of Raghu's valour. Indra also acquaints
Dilipa, at Raghu's request, with what had occurred; highly gratified"
