41. Verily the Tilaka plant, which was variegated with bees,
charming like marks of collyrium, alighting on rows (or
collections) of flowers, did but grace (adorn) the forest site just as
the 'tilaka' mark decorates a young woman.
42. The Jasmine creeper, the charming beloved of the trees,
fascinated the mind (of the lookers-on) by the beauty of the
smiles, brought about by flowers, possessing the smell of honey
(wine) and spreading over the lower lip in the form of the sprouts.
43. By garments surpassing (lit. throwing into the back-
ground) the brilliance of the morning sun, by shoots of barley
which had obtained a place on the ears and by the cooings of
the female cuckoos,-by these agents (lit. troops) of the God of
Love amorous persons were placed wholly in the power of women
(lit. made solely devoted to women).
44. The bunch of blossoms of the Tilaka tree, fully developed
in its parts by means of white pollen'and coming in contact with
swarms of bees, appeared of a like beauty with the pearls in the
net-like ornament worn in the hair.
45. Swarms of bees followed the dust of the filaments of
flowers rising from the garden agitated by the wind, which was
the banner of the God of Love armed with his bow and the
beautifying cosmetic for the face of the Vernal Beauty.
46. Enjoying the festival of the season in which there were
new swings, the women though clever (in the sports) relaxed
(the grip of) their tender (lit. creeper-like) arms in holding the
ropes of their seats (i. e. the swings) through the desire of ein-
bracing their lovers.
47.
Give up (ye fair ones) your anger excited by jealousy;
enough of your quarrels; the age so favourable to love-sports,
(youth), when once gone, will never return"-the wish (or advice)
of the God of Love, as it were, being thus communicated by the
cuckoos, the women devoted themselves to sport.
48. Now, after having enjoyed at his pleasure (to his satis
faction) the festival of the season in company with sportive
women (his attendants), the king, resembling the God Vishnu,
(lit. Destroyer of Madhu), Vasanta, and the God of Love (lit.
tormentor of the mind), longed for the pleasure of chase.
49. It (t. e. chase) makes one intimate (lit. produces familia-
rity ) with (the art of) shooting down a moving mark (game); it
gives the knowledge of their gestures in (moment) of fear and rage;
