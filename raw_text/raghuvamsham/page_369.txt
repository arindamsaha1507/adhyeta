"Canto IX. ]
( 71 )
7. Neither love for hunting, nor gambling, nor wine having
the reflection of the moon for its ornament, nor a beloved
(mistress) of fresh youth ( i. e. in the prime of youth), diverted
(the mind of) him who was striving for rise ( prosperity ).
8. He did not address a supplicating speech even to Indra
although he (Indra) was his (Das'aratha's) lord, nor did he tell
a lie even in jest. Being free from (the influence of) anger he
did not use (lit. speak) abusive (or harsh) language even towards
his enemies.
9. The (subordinate) kings obtained both rise and fall from
(i. e. at the hands of) the descendant of Raghu. He was friendly
towards those who did not transgress his commands but had a
stern heart towards those who defied him.
10.
He, whose bow was string, conquered the Earth girt by the
ocean (lit. whose circumference is the ocean) by means of one
chariot only (i. e. without the aid of any body else). While his
army abounding in elephants and steeds, impetuous through
speed, simply proclaimed his victory.
11. Verily the oceans, thundering like the clouds, served as
drums proclaiming the victory of him, who, being an eminent
bowman, conquered the Earth by means of a matchless (or single)
chariot furnished with a protecting apparatus, and whose wealth
equalled that of Kubera.
12. Indra destroyed the force of the wings of mountains by
means of (his ) hundred-edged adamant; while he (Das'aratha),
whose face resembled a fresh lotus, routed the army and the allies
of his enemies by his twanging bow, that poured forth a shower
of arrows.
13. Hundreds of kings touched the feet of him (lit. touched
him at his feet) whose prowess knew no repulse, with the rays
of the jewels in their crowns having their splendour enhanced by
the redness (lustre) of the nails, just as the gods bow down to
Indra.
14. Having taken compassion on the wives of his enemies,
whose hairs were undecorated and who had caused their infant
sons to fold (join) their hands (as a token of submission) to him,
he returned from the shore of the great ocean to his capital not
(in any way) inferior to Alaká.
15. Seeing that the Goddess of Wealth would escape whenever
there was a loop-hole he whose lustre resembled that of fire and"
