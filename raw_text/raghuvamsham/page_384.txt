"(86)
[Canto X.
75. At the very moment, the tear-drops of the goddess of
Royalty of the demons were scattered on ground in the form
of jewels from the crowns of Ràvana.
76. The drums of the gods first made in heaven the beginning
of the play of musical instruments to be caused at the birth of
sons in the case of him who now got excellent sons.
77. And a shower of the Santánaka flowers fell on his palace,
and that itself became the first arrangement of the auspicious
decorarions necessary on that joyful occasion.
78. The princes whose purificatory rites were performed and
who drank the milk of the nurses, grew up along with their
father's joy, which was, as it were, the first-born.
79. Their natural modesty increased on account of education
(discipline), just as the native brightness of fire increases (is
intensified) by offerings.
80. (Being) friendly (lit. not adversely disposed) towards each
other, they greatly adorned the unblemished family of the Rsghus,
just as the seasons (by their conjoint influence) adorn the Nan-
dana garden.
81. Although fraternal affection (among those brothers) was
equal, still, as Râma and Lakshmana gladly formed a pair, so did
Bharata and S'atrughna.
82. The unity (or harmony) between (the members of) those
pairs was never interrupted, like that between fire and wind or the
moon and the ocean.
83. The princes attracted the minds of the people by their
prowess and modesty, like the days with dark clouds at the close
of the summer.
84. The progeny of that king, divided fourfold, appeared like
an embodied incarnation of the four ends of human life viz.)
righteousness (performance of religious duties), attainment of
riches (or, worldly prosperity), gratification of desires, and final
emancipation.
85. Devoted to their father, they pleased him, the lord of the
four quarters to their ends, by their merits, just as the great
oceans propitiated him by (their) jewels.
86. The Lord of the kings (i. e. the Supreme King) looked
pre-eminent (or shone) by those four (sons) who were the portions
of the God Vishpu, like the celestial elephant with his four tusks
that had blunted the edges of the swords of the demons, like
statesmanship with the four expedients whose employment is
clearly indicated by the final object attained (or, the conclusion
of peace), and like the god Vishnu with his four arms as long
as a yoke."
