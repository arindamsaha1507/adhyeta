( 121 )
(that which is spread) sf fagt:, when meaning a seat that is spread
on the ground' (for pious Brâhmanas or ascetics who do not sit on
any other seat). Far: is the form when referring to speech ( a
detailed description); as in ³ sata. The is changed to
by Pán. VIII. 3. 93. See Sanj.
S'1. 4.
:-3 the front чáſa; a leader, the foremost of.
-Those who arranged the Mantras or Vedic hymns; or
rather those to whom the hymns were revealed; cf. Sáyaṇa-
'न हि वेदस्य कर्तारी द्रष्टारः सर्व एव हि' | Or the Mantras referred to
here may be those of the Atharva Veda, in which case we may
translate-of those who are the authors of the mantras'; cf. I. 61.
कुशामबुद्धे - कुशाग्रमिव बुद्धिर्यस्य | one whose intellect is as sharp
as the blade of Kus'a grass, very acute or sharp. ::
क्रियां कृत्वा वेदमस्मे प्रयच्छति'; 'he is called a Guru who performs
the initiatory ceremonies (3¶¶¶) and teaches the Veda.' (Yâj.)
There are eleven Gurus (not taken in this technical sense )
mentioned by Devala — आचार्यश्च पिता ज्येष्ठो भ्राता चैव महीपतिः । मातुलः
श्वशुरस्त्राता मातामहपितामहौ ॥ वर्णज्येष्ठः पितृव्यश्व पुंस्येते गुरवो मताः ॥ चैतन्यम् -
Înača vraŝaz48 The simile here is peculiarly appropriate. As
the world of living beings is wholly and solely indebted to the sun
for all its activity, its very life, so the disciple was fully indebted
to his preceptor for the whole stock of his knowledge,--knowledge
on which his future life depended. The King's question here is in
Accordance with the precept 'ब्राह्मणं कुशलं पृच्छेत्' &c.
S1. 5. अपि --'and'. अन्तरायः - अन्तरं व्यवधानमयते गच्छत्यन्तरस्य वा
अयः अयनं from इ and aff. घञ् or the root अयू and अचू. कच्चित् – ६३ks
a question mixed with hope, the expected answer being 'yes or no '
according to the form of the question, and is translated by
I hope that' &c.; see A. G. § 263. - Fur
The
saint would be exhausting the store of his penance if he had to use
his power of imprecation in removing obstacles or subduing
temptations; and hence the question of the king. (See ft.--note 5).
For ancient kings considered it their duty to protect sages from
all sorts of disturbances. Cf. Kir. II. 48, gisgemmas: vai 4:
&c.; S'âk. I. 13, V. 14.
S1. 6. आधार &c. - आधारस्य बन्ध आधारबन्धः । प्रगतो मुखं प्रमुखः
(प्रादिस०), आधारबन्धः प्रमुखों येषाम् ॥ यद्वा प्रकृष्टं मुखं प्रमुखम् । आधारबन्धः
प्रमुखे येषाम् । विशेषः - Malli. takee this in the sense of अतिशय; but
(' difference') will do here.
