power. :-This is the celebrated sage Agastya, who is said
to have been born in a water jar. For the account of his birth along
with Vasishtha from the divine Mitra and Varuna, see ft.-note and
Sâyaṇa on Rg. VII. 33. 11. Agastya is said to rest in the heavens
in the form of the star Canopus' belonging to the constellation
Argo Navis i. e. the lunar mansion | Agastya begins to rise at
sunset when the sun is in fig ( leo ) i. e. in August, from the latter
half of S'râvaṇa, just before the commencement of or autumn.
Here there is a reference to the power of Agastya.
See VI, 61 and note thereon. Agastya had once drunk off the

bes the changes worked in the bulls by autumn. The bulls had lost
their flesh and their humps had dwindled away before the rains set
in for want of pasture and the hard work they had to do in the rainy
-season. But now at the advent of autumn, all things being favoura-
ble, they grew in flesh and regained their spirits, and so began their
butting sports, when grazing by the riverside.

Saptaparna trees naturally sent forth the rut-like scent from their
flowers (i. e. one part) only; but the elephants, thinking that they did
