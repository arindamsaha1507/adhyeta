(39)
43. Just then there emerged from the river a wild elephant,
whose plunge (lit. entrance) into the water had already been
indicated by black bees hovering above (over the surface of the
water) and whose expansive cheeks were clean, as the ichor
had been entirely washed off.
44. Who betrayed his butting-sports on the skirts of the
Rikshavat mountain by means of his two rock-blunted tusks,
which were
checkered with blue lines running upwards,
although completely washed of all mineral dust.
45. As he faced the bank and cut ( his way) with (loud) noise
(through) the large waves with his trunk quick in its contractions
and protrusions, he looked as if engaged in breaking asunder the
bolts of his stall.
46. The mountain-like elephant dragging with him by his
breast the meshes of moss (s'aivala) reached the bank afterwards,
the current of waters violenty agitated by him having reached
it first.
47. The darkish splendour of the ichor flowing from the broad
cheeks of that one (single of its kind, chief &c.) elephant, which
had been stopped for a moment by his plunge into water, shone
forth afresh at the sight of tame (lit. other than wild) elephants..
48. On smelling his unbearable rut whose flow was as strong-
smelling (or fragrant) as the milky exudation of the saptachchhada
(seven-leaved) tree, the huge elephants in the army turned back
(shied), notwithstanding (or defying) the strenuous efforts of
their drivers.
49. In a moment he threw the encampment into utter confu-
sion, cleared of horses which tore their bonds and fled, with the
chariots fallen to the ground, their axles being broken and with
the warriors perplexed in protecting the ladies.
50. The prince, who knew (from the S'âstras) that a king
ought not to kill a wild elephant, not drawing his horn-made-bow
to any great length, struck the rushing elephant on the forehead
with an arrow, ( merely) wishing to make him turn back.
51. The moment he was wounded, as history tells us, he
quitted the from of an elephant, and assumed the lovely figure
of a heavenly being, encircled with a flashing halo of light, and
looked at by the army astonished at the (curious ) occurrence.
52. Then having showered on the prince the flowers of the
heavenly trees that came to him through his superhuman power,"
