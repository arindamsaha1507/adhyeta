[Canto VII.
13. "It was right that the princess of Bhoja's house, though
sought in marriage by princes whom she had never seen, thought
self-election to be well for her; how, else, could she have obtained
a husband worthy of her, as Lakshmf obtained Narayana (for
her lord) ?
14. If the lord of creation had not united together the couple
possessed of mutually enviable beauty, all in vain would have
been the trouble taken by him in bestowing such exquisite beanty
upon these two.
15. Certainly these two are Rati and her consort, the god of
love incarnated in a mortal form; this is why the maiden has
selected one who is a counterpart of her own self, from among
thousands of kings; for the mind is aware of union formed in a
previous birth (life)."
16. Hearing these words pleasing to the ears, uttered from the
months of the ladies of the city, the prince (Aja) arrived at the
house of his relative, adorned with auspicious decorations.
17. Then having quickly alighted from the she-elephant seiz-
ing the hand stretched out by the lord of the Kàmarûpas, he
entered the inner gradrangular courtyard, shown by the
Vidarbha king, as if he entered the heart of the ladies (assembled
there).
18. Seated on a costly throue, he accepted the offerings of
worship with jewels and mixed with the Madhuparka (an oblation
consisting of curds, milk, honey &c.) and a pair of silk garments
presented by Bhoja, as also the glances of the beautiful ladies.
19. He, dressed in silken garments, was led near the bride by
the well-behaved keepers of the harem, as the (water of the) sea
with its clear lines of foam is carried on to the shore by the new
-rays of the moon.
20. There the revered priest of the Bhoja king, almost equal to
fire in effulgence, preseuted offerings of clarified butter and other
things to the sacred fire, and having made it a witness to the
marriage rite, united together the bride and the bridegroom.
21. That prince, holding the bride's hand with his own, looked
still more beautiful, like the mango-tree, after it has reached the
tender leaf of a neighbouring as oka tree by means of a correspond-
ing leaf of its own."
