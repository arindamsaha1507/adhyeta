51. When the lord of beasts had ceased, having said this
much, the mountain too, on account of the echo of his words
resounding in the caves, seemed affectionately and loudly to say
the very same thing to the king.
52. Having heard the words of the attendant of S'iva, the
king of men spoke again, his compassion being excited all the

together in this forest tract; hence, O follower of the lord of
beings, it behoves you not to reject the request of me, your
connexion."
59. To the lion, who said 'So let be,' Dilîpa, his hand released
from restraint the very moment, offered, after laying down his
weapons, his body, like (as if it were no better than) a lump of
