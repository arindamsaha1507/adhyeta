tears). Even iron (when) heated becomes soft; what need we
(then) say of those possessing bodies?
44. Alas! If even flowers can take away life by (coming in)
contact with the body, what else will not be the weapon of Fate
wishing to strike (kill)?
45. Or, the God of death (lit. destroyer of the people) under-
takes to destroy tender things by means of tender things alone.
The lotus plant which is destroyed by frost I consider as the first
instance of this.
46. If this wreath has the power to take away life, why does it.
not kill me, (when) placed on my breast? By the will of the Al-
mighty even poison sometimes becomes (is changed into) nectar,
and nectar poison.
47. Or perhaps, through the adverseness of my fate, the
Creator has created this (strange) thunderbolt, since the tree was
not felled down by it while it cut off the creeper twining round
its branches.
48. When you did not long show disregard towards me
even when I had given offence, how (is it) (that) all at once you
do not consider this person (i. e. myself) who is quite innocent
as worthy of being spoken to ?
49. O lady of pleasant smiles, you really think me to be a
rogue falsely making love, since you have gone to the other world,
never to return, without bidding me farewell.
50. If this wretched life of mine followed my beloved first, why
has it returned without her? Let it (then) suffer the grief, intense
on account of its own action.
51. Even the drops of perspiration brought on by the fatigue
of enjoyment (still) remain on your face; whereas you yourself
are gone (dead); fie upon this transitory state of living beings!
52. Never before have I done, even in thought, anything dis-
agreeable to you; why do you then abandon me? Really I am
lord (husband) of earth in name only; my love springing from
(or deepened by) real internal feeling is centred in you.
53. O lady with thighs (tapering) like the fore-arm, the wind
shaking your curly hair, dark like the bees and set (adorned) with
flowers, makes my mind hopeful of your return (to life).
54. Therefore, O my beloved, be you pleased to remove my
brief quickly by awaking, just as the herb at night dispels the
darkness in the caves of the Himálaya by its light."
