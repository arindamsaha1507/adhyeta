[ Canto V.
lively (lit. other than rough) pupil rolling about within and the
lotus with a black bee moving inside.
69. The morning breeze, as if desirous of obtaining, by means
of borrowed properties, the natural fragrance of the breath of your
mouth, bears away the loosened flowers of trees from their stalks
and comes in contact with lotuses opened by the rays of the
morning sun (Aruņa).
70. The dew-drops, white like the well-cleansed pearls of a
necklace, fallen on the tender leaves of trees with their interiors
red, resemble, on account of the position of advantage thus
gained by them (or their increased excellence), your sportive smile
fallen on your lip, brightened by the splendour of your teeth.
71. While the sun, the store of radiant heat, does not rise,
even before that, darkness has been, all at once, dispelled by
Aruna; when, O hero, you have taken the lead in battles, will
(why should) your sire himself extirpate the foes ?
72. Your elephants, with their sleep shaken off from both
sides, are leaving their beds, pulling at their clanking chains: the
elephants whose bud-like tusks seem as if they had pierced
the red-mineral-skirts of a mountain, on account of their having
come in contact with the rosy tints of the morning sun.
73. O lotus-eyed one, the horses of the breed of the Vanâyu
country (Persian horses), tied in spacious tents, having given
up their sleep, are soiling with the warm breath (vapour) of their
mouth the pieces of rock-salt placed before them for being licked.
74. The flower-offering, being withered, has become loose in
texture; the lamps are void of the throbbing circles (halo) of
their light; and this your sweet-speaking parrot resting in its
cage, imitates our speech employed to rouse you.
75. The prince, his sleep dispelled by the young bards singing
their songs in this strain, instantly left his bed, just as the heav-
enly elephant, Supratîka, awakened from sleep by the royal
swans cackling sweetly under excitement, leaves the sandy beach
of the Ganges".
76. Then, having finished the rites proper for day-break, as
prescribed in the S'a'stras, the prince, with beautiful eyelashes,
after his toitet was finished in a fitting style by experts (in that
art), repaired to the assembly of kings gathered in the hall of the
self-election-marriage."
