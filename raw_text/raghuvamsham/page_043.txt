in a work of such character. On the contrary, it amounts to a
triumph of skill on the poet's part to have welded together his
detached episodes without incongruity in presentation. Moreover,
a unity of plot of a certain kind does exist, if we remember that
the incidents mentioned in the poem are all to be interpreted as
part of the central idea running through the poem, viz. the
portraying of the leading characteristics of an ideal king according
to the A'ryan standard. Viewed in this light, even the slight
charge of "a formless plot" vanishes into background, and we
see the Raghuvamsa for what it is, being a word-painting, in the
most polished phraseology of an accomplished poet, of the ideal of
kingship; that is the theme of the Raghuvams, and not so much.
the complete life-history of each King. It is, therefore, inevitable
that, as remarked by Dr. Ryder, we must regard the Raghuvamsa.
as a poem "in which single episodes take a stronger hold upon the
reader than does the unfolding of an ingenious plot."
It is in the Raghuvamsa, as in the Sâkuntala, that Kâlidása is
seen at his best. The poem has been most popular in India from very
early times and has evoked an unending chorus of praise from the
learned and beginners alike. Stray lines, detached stanzas, and even
whole Cantos of the poem are on the lips of many a cultured Indian
to whom Kâlidâsa's muse embodies the very essence of the pleasure
derivable from poetry: a ca, says a well-known
subháshita, Almost every Canto of the poem makes a special
appeal to the reader by reason of some peculiar grace, whether
of mellifluous style, or of life-like description, or of dramatic
dialogue. Let the student examine the various Cantos for
himself. In the very opening stanzas (5-9) of the first Canto the
poet strikes the key-note of the whole poem in a résumé of the
accomplishments of the kings of the Raghu line. Then follows the
description of Dilipa's good rule as well as that of his journey
to Vasishtha's hermitage, which is of a kind that leaves its
impress on the mind long after it is read, bringing visually
before us the benign ruler and his simple subjects by such

with the lion, and in Canto III. Raghu's encounter with Indra are
classic examples, known to almost every Indian Sanskrit-reading
school-boy, of spirited and balanced dialogue and bright narration,
apart from the noble ideals of self-sacrifice and personal valour
which they vividly place before him. In the fourth Canto we have"
