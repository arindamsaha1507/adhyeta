In the tenth Canto we have the passage where the gods praise
Vishnu, which has its counterpart in Kum. II.; it does not possess
any particular interest. In the eleventh we have a life-like descrip-
tion of the journey of the two boy-princes to Visvâmitra's hermitage;
its chief feature is the encounter of Râma with Parasurâma, and the
graceful way in which the poet brings the former out of it.
The twelfth Canto has become one of the weakest in the whole
poem, as the entire story of the Rámáyana from the death of
Dasaratha in Ayodhyâ to the killing of Râvana in Lankâ
has been very hurriedly gone over. The poet felt the necessity
of abridging it in this manner; for otherwise his poem
would have grown interminably long. Dr. Ryder observes
(pp. 150-151)-"It may well be doubted whether the cantos
dealing with Ráma are the most successful. They are too com-
pressed, too briefly allusive. Kálidása attempts to tell the story
in about one-thirtieth of the space given to it by his great
predecessor, Vâlmîki. The result is much loss by omission and
much loss by compression. Many of the best episodes of the
Râmâyana are quite omitted by Kálidása: for example, the story
of the jealous humpback who eggs on Queen Kaikeyî to demand
her two boons; the beautiful scene in which Sîtá insists on follow-
ing Râma into the forest; the account of the somnolent giant
Pot-ear Other fine episodes are so briefly alluded to as to
lose all their charm: for example, the story of the golden deer
that attracts the attention of Ráma while Rávana is stealing his
wife; the journey of the monkey Hanâmat to Rávana's fortress
and his interview with Sîtá. The Ráma-story, as told by
Válmiki, is one of the great epic stories of the world. It has been
for two thousand years and more the story par excellence of the
Hindus There is, therefore, real matter for regret in the fact
that so great a poet as Kal.dāsa should have treated it in a way
not quite worthy of it and of himself."
While we recognize the force of this criticism, we cannot
quite agree with the learned scholar in his explanation. Dr. Ryder
says that Kálidása did not care to put himself "into direct
competition with Vālmîki," and thus to challenge comparison with
him. While Kâlidâsa doubtless felt great admiration for Valmîki
and his work, the real explanation of the weakness of the twelfth
and the fifteenth cantos is, in our opinion, to be sought elsewhere.
It is that the poet felt the need of abridging somewhere, and these
