[ Canto VIII.
68. Her face, at once freed from the sadness arising from the
enemy, glowed with joy, like a mirror with its natural brightness
restored to it by the disappearance of the moisture caused by
breath.
69. Though delighted yet overcome by bashfulness, she
congratulated her beloved lord not herself, but by the words of her
female friends, just as a natural site, sprinkled over with the
drops of fresh rain water, hails the train of clouds by the notes of
the peacocks.
70. Thus he, free from blemish, having placed his left foot on
the heads of the kings (i. e. having inflicted upon them a shame-

became the goddess of his martial victory, embodied in a corpo-
real frame, with the ends of her hair rendered rough by the dust
raised by the chariots and horses.

son as he came back victorious, accompanied by his laudable
bride; and then having made over to his son's care the household
became eager to pursue the path of tranquillity; for the descen-
dants of the solar dynasty are never for (never wish to cling
to the household, when there is one able to bear the yoke
(burden) of the family..

3. Having undergone the ceremony of sprinking along with
him (2. e. the prince Aja, at the time of his coronation) with the
water consecrated by Vasish/ha, the Earth expressed as it were
the gratification (of her wishes) by her clear (white) exhalations.
All the rites (connected with his coronation ceremony)
being performed by (Vasish/ha) his spiritual guide, he became
unassailable to his enemies; for it is a union of fire with wind that
