race, rather vaguely, when he speaks of it as having been described
before by "former writers" (qaf: I. 4). Here the use of the
plural is significant, and it obviously includes others besides
Válmîki. By the others we can only understand the compilers of
the Purâņas. The Purâpas are not all modern works, and many
of them have been shown to date from times much anterior to
the Christrian era. Of these Purânas he seems to have used the
Vishnu-, the Vâyu-, and the Padma- in particular. A word
of caution, however, is here necessary. The Puranas in their
present form bear evidences of having been re-modelled and
re-written at various periods, and their current recensions may
not be those with which our poet was familiar. Indeed, in
some of them (e. g. in the Padma-P.) it appears as though
the stories had been revised in the light of the works of Kâlidása.
Hence, any remarks which one would be inclined to pass on
the so-called "changes" made by the post in his sources must
be made with due reservations, since we may not have before
us the actual version which was accessible to Kâlidása, but some
later redaction of it.19
the
With these preliminary remarks, we shall proceed to examine
poem itself. In the first place, the list of kings as given by the
poet does not exactly agree with any that are available to us, 20 but
agrees nearest with the one in the Vishnu-Parâna, with a slight
difference. The Purâns mentions a number of Kings before Dilipa,
but these are omitted by Kâlidâsa. The Vishna-Purana (as also
the Vâyu-P.) represents Raghu as the son of one Dîrghabâhu,
grandson of Dilipa; while Kâlidâsa mentions him as the son of
Dilipa himself. Kålidâsa's account stops with Agnivarna, while
the Vishna-P. enumerates a number of kings after him; but there
is no incongruency here, since our poem is probably incomplete, a
point which we have discussed elsewhere.
Thus the line of succession in the Ragh. practically agrees with
that of the Vishnu-P. and may be accepted as being historically
true. But what about the various incidents specially described in
19 This might be said to some extent of the Ramayana also. There
are at present three different recensions of the Râmnâyaṇa extant, and
"about one-third of the s'lokas in each recension occurs in neither of the
other two." (Macdonell's History of Sanskrit Literature, p. 303).
20 Thus the Râmn. (Bâla. Sarga 70) gives the genealogy quite
differently.
