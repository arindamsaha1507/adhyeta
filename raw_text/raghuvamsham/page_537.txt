:--The important kingdom of Anga was situated on the right
bank of the Ganges and to the south of Kaus'iki Kachchha. Its
capital was Champá, sometimes called Angapurî, Lomapádapuri or
capital of king Lomapáda, Karṇapurî or capital of king Karṇa, and
Mâliní. According to Hiouen Thsang it stood on the Ganges about
24 miles west of a rocky island. General Cunningham has shown that
this description applies to the hill opposite to Pâthargháta, that it is
24 miles east of Bhagalpur and that there are villages called Cham-
pápura and Champánagara adjoining the last. According to Sanskrit
writers the town was situated on the Bhágîrathî, east (properly
south-east) of Mithilá, and near the confluence of the Kaus'ikî. So
there is no doubt that Champå stood at or about Bhagalpur. Champá
was probably so called from the abundance of Champá or Champaka
flowers; at any rate, according to the Mah.-Bhâr. there was a
Champaka wood near Kaus'ikî. In the present s'l. there is an allu-
sion to elephants, which are not found in the hills to the south and
east of Bhagalpur, but in the Himalayan regions on the north, so
it seems Anga at one time included Kaus'ikî Kachchha. gar
&c. Tradition has it that this king was called away by Indra to
assist him in a war with the demons, when his youthful beauty
enamoured the damsels of heaven (see Sanj ). विनीतनाग:-

: the composers or writers of aphorisms on the
elephantine science. According to the commentators Malli., Hem.
and Ohár., the elephants of this king were trained by such eminent
original writers on the science and art of training elephants, as
Pâlakapya, Gautama, Mrigacharman and others. According to the
story given by Malli, this kingwa troop of the elephants of
heaven descended to this world on account of some curse. Unable
to seize them he applied to Indra, who directed some of the
heavenly sages to accompany him to the world of mortals and to
train the elephants for him. It was thus that the science of
