CANTO X.
1. While he (Das'aratha), equal in majesty to Indra and in
wealth none the less, was ruling over the Earth, a little less than
a myriad of years passed away.
2. And yet. he did not obtain that light called 'a Son' which
instantaneously dispels the gloom of sorrow and is the means of
obtaining freedom from the debt due to ancestors.
3. For a long time did the king, whose progeny was awaiting
(the appearance of) an efficient cause, remain like the oce with
its production of the jewels not manifested before the churning
(i.e. before its being churned).
4. The venerable priests, Rishyas ringa and others, who were
self-subdued, commenced the sacrifice conferring the blessing of
a'son, for him who was desirous of issue.
5. At about the same time the gods, harassed by Rávaṇa, went
to Hari, just as travellers, oppressed with heat, repair to an
umbrageous tree.
6. Just as they reached the ocean, the Primeval Being awoke.
Absence of delay is, indeed, the sign of future success in an under.
taking.
7. The gods beheld him, reclined on the seat of the body of
the serpent, with His person illuminated by the ascending rays of
the jewels in the circle of the hoods of that serpent-
8. Him, who had placed His feet on the lap of Lakshmi, seated
on a lotus, from which the girdle was separated by the (interven-
ing) silken garment and on which were spread her tender palms-
9. Him, whose eyes were like full-blown lotuses, whose gar-
ment resembled the morning sunshine, who was easily seen (lit.
whose sight was easily obtainable) by ascetics and who was
(therefore) like the autumnal day, which has blooming lotuses
for the eyes and morning sunshine for the garment and which
is delightful to look at in the beginning (i.e. at its commence-
ment)-
10. Him, who wore on his broad breast the essence of the
(oceanic) waters called 'Kaustubha', which served as a toilet-mirror
to Lakshmf and which covered with its lustre the mark S'rívatsa-
11. Him, who ou account of his branch-like arms decorated
with heavenly ornaments, appeared like another Pârijáta mani:
festing itself in the midst of waters-"
