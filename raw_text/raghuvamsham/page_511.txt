a reply to Raghu's question. Had it been the primary object of
Kautsa to acquaint the king with the facts by way of a prayer we
should have expected तम् instead of तस्मै by the rule ' कर्तुरीप्सिततमं कर्म ' ।
The Dat. here may be explained either as arq; or by 'af'
रघुं प्रीणयितुम् ; or by 'कर्मणा यमभिप्रैति' -रघुमभिप्रेत्य स्मयावेश--स्मयस्य
vanity : touch or influence. The qofe are the four
classes of men viz. the Brâhmaṇas, Kshatriyas, Vais'yas and
S'údras. For the As'ramas see note on '' 1. 10. -:

grazzgreaîíà qoîî ¦ a Brahmachârin, ¶ means 'moral excellence,'
which is explained as absolute abstaining from eight kinds of
sensual pleasures, for which see Malli. on af Kir. I. 1. The
1
affix a showing possession is added to this word in this sense alone;
in other cases we shall have a Vide the Kás'. on 'quizain'
Pán. V. 2. 134. विचक्षणः - विशेषेण चष्टे इति विचक्षू + अन ( युच् ); wise,
learned, clever, used as a noun. It properly means 'what
is brought on or introduced by qala (occasion or opportunity)' what
is introduced with relevancy, there being a fit opportunity for it;
hence what is pertinent or to the point, as opposed to which
means for which there is no proper opportunity' i. e. which does
not refer to the subject under discussion, irrelevant.
Ś1. 20. -indec. used in the sense of the Acc. by the rule
“ŞıØ¤Ã£ÆFÐÃ¶' Pân. II. 3. 5. Hegímāmgarcrg-see ft -note
उपचार (उपचर्यते । अनेन वा ) may mean here 'service (सेवा) or materials
of worship.' अस्खलित उपचारः यस्याम् in which the service I rendered
him was without a flaw, was unswerving; or disa zgar gedig
in which no materials of worship were wanting i. e. I ministered
fully to all his wants. gra-indec. der. fr. g+at, being
changed to gr; in the first place, or foremost, i, e. above fees.
Ś1. 21. अर्थकार्यम्-अर्थस्य of wealth कार्य scantiness.
have the Gen. Tat. here, as the prohibition '&c. is not
obligatory in the case of a word expressive.of quality. Cf. Sid.
Kau. अनित्योयं गुणेन निषेधः । 'तदशिष्यं संज्ञाप्रमाणत्वात्' इत्यादिनिर्देशात् ।
तेनार्थगौरवं बुद्धिमान्द्यमित्यादि सिद्धम् । विद्यापरिसंख्या - For the 14 vidyas
see Sanj. The six aingas are शिक्षा कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं ज्योतिषां गतिः।
छन्दोविचितिरित्येष षडङ्गो वेद उच्यते ॥
