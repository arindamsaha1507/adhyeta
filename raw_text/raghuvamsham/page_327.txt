(29)
routed, like that of a tusker, which is marked by trees, shorn of-
their fruits, uprooted and destroyed in various ways.
34. Tans overrunning the kingdoms in the east the victor came
to the shore of the great ocean, dark with the forests of tálí trees.
35. From him the uprooter of all that did not bend before him,
as from the current of a river, the Suhmas saved themselves by
following the course of cane-plants (adopting the policy of submis-
sion).
36. Having by his power uprooted the Vanga kings, who had
resisted him by means of their ships, he, the leader, planted
(memoriál) pillars of victory in the intervals of (i. e. the islets
between) the streams of the Ganges.
37. Like the Kalama plauts which bend low to (or to the
lotuses at their roots and yield a rich harvest after having been
first uprooted and then transplanted, they, first uprooted and then
reinstated, bowed down to his lotus-like feet and honoured him by
gifts of riches.
38. He crossed the river Kapis'â with his troops by means of,
a bridge formed of the elephants and marched towards Kalinga,
the way being led by the Utkala (Orissa) princes.
39. He plauted his mighty prowess (made it keenly felt) on.
the head (peak) of the mountain Mahendra, just as a driver
does his sharp goad in the head of a Gambhîravedi ( not easily
senstive to pain ) elephant.
40. The king of Kalinga, strong in his war elephants, received
him with showers of missiles, as a mountain, showering stones,
would (receive ) Indra, prepared to cut its wings.
41. Having borne a heavy shower of the enemies' iron--
arrows, the descendant of Kakutstha won the goddess of victory,.
as if after having taken an auspicious bath.
42. There, his soldiers, having prepared places for wassail,
quaffed in (cups of) betel leaves coconut-wine, and also the glory
of their enemies.
43. The king, a righteous conqueror, took away the wealth
and not the territory of the lord of Mahendra, first made a captive
but afterwards released.
44. Then marching along the sea-coast, lined with betel-nut-
trees bearing fruit, he, to whom victory was not a thing to be"
