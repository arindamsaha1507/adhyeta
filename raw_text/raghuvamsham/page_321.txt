"Canto III.]
( 23 )
43. Recognizing him to be Indra, by his hundreds of wink-
less eyes, and also by his green steeds, Raghu addressed him in
a deep voice that reached the vaults of heaven, forcing him to
turn back, as it were, thereby.
44. "O lord of gods ! you alone are described by sages as the
first of those who enjoy shares at sacrifices; how do you then
proceed to obstruct the sacrifical rites of my sire, purified for
( engaged in ) the constant performance of sacrificial vow?
45. The enemies of sacrifices ought, indeed, to be always check-
ed (suppressed) by you, the lord of the three worlds, possessed
of divine power of vision; but if you yourself stand in the way
of the rites undertaken by the righteous, all pious work must be
at an end !
46. Therefore, O Indra, it behoves you to set free the horse,
the most essential part of the great sacrifice; great lords, who lead
the paths pointed out by the Vedas, never adopt a sinful course."
47. On hearing these bold words spoken by Raghu, the lord
of the denizens of heaven, astonished, turned back the chariot
and began to return a reply.
48. "O son of a kshatriya, what you say is all true; but those
who regard their fame as their wealth must protect it from their
enemies; and your father, by his sacrifices, is bent upon eclipsing
the same in its entirety of me, so well known in all the worlds.
49. As Hari alone is known by the name of Purushottama, as
Tryambaka (the three-eyed god), and none else, is styled Mahes'-
vara, so do the sages know me as S'atakratu. This designation
(respectively attached to us three) does not refer (belong) to a
second.
50. Therefore has this horse of your father been carried away
by me, imitating the sage Kapila; away with (nothing will be
gained from) an effort in this matter; set not your foot upon the
path pursued by Sagara's progeny (sons.)"
51. Then the dauntless protector of the sacrificial horse laugh-
ed and again addressed Purandara:-"Take up your weapon, if this
be your determination; you will never gain your object without
conquering Raghu."
52. Having thus addressed Indra, he, with his face turned
upwards, and wishing to fix an arrow on his bow, stood with his
majestic form appearing to advantage in the attitude of A'li dha"
