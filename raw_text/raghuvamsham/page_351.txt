( 53 )
In the meantime, the bridegroom accompanied by the bride
reached the royal road, which was decked all over with fresh
decorations, which was marked by ornamental archways radiant
like rainbows, and which had the sunlight kept off from it by the
shade of banners.
5. Then the fair women of the city, setting aside all othe
occupations in their eagerness to have a look at the bridegroom'
acted in the following manner, in mansions having lattice-window
or gold.
S
6. One lady walking with haste to the window did not at all
think of tying up again her mass of hair, the wreath of flowers from
which had dropped down on account of its knot having got
loosened though she held it with her hand, until she reached. the
window.
7. A certain lady, snatching her forefoot held by her dressing
naid, while the red paint on it was yet wet, and giving up her
graceful gait, stretched out a line of foot-prints marked with red
lac as far as the window.
8. Another lady, having adorned her right eye with collyrium
while her left eye was yet without it, went, in that very state, to
the vicinity of the window, holding (in her hand) the painting
stick.
9. Another of the fair sex, who was looking through the lat-
tices of the window, did not tie up the knot of her wearing gar-
ment, loosened by her (hasty) movement; but stood, holding up
her garment with her hand, the lustre of the ornaments put upon
it entering her navel.
10. The half-strung waist-band of another lady who rose in
haste, the jewels of which dropped at every ill-placed step, had
at last only the bare thread left of it, fastened round the big toe,.
at the time.
11. The windows, having their holes filled up with the faces of
those ladies full of intense curiosity, having the smell of wine
within and the rolling eyes for black bees hovering about, seemed
to be decorated with so many lotuses.
12. Those ladies drinking, as it were, with their eyes the son
of Raghu, did not attend to any other object (at all); thus the
functions of their other organs of sense seemed to be transferred
to their eyes."
