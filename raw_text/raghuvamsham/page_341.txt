"CANTO VI.
1. There he saw the protectors of the human world ( kings),
seated on thrones placed on richly furnished platforms, and attired
in fascinating dresses, (thereby) imitating the majesty of the gods
moving in celestial cars.
2. The mind of kings seeing Aja (lit. the scion of Kakutstha's
race), who looked like Kâma with his corporeal frame restored to
him by S'iva, at (lit. accepting) the entreaties of Rati, lost all
hope of winning Indumatí.
3. The prince ascended the dais pointed out by the Vidarbha
king, by means of a well-constructed flight of steps, as the young
cub of the lord of beasts (lion) climbs the lofty peak of a
mountain by means of (step-like) projecting rocks.
4. Seated on a throne covered with tapestry of the richest
colour and set with jewels, his majestic appearance was most
comparable with Guha (Kàrttikeya ) when riding his peacock.
5. Her own self, portioned out in a thousand ways into those
rows of kings by Lakshmî, and dazzling to the eyes on account of
the appearance of a peculiar effulgence, shone pre-eminently like
the flash of lightning which distributes itself into so many rows
of clouds.
6. In the midst of those kings, all seated on magnificent thrones,
and dressed in splendid costumes, the son of Raghu alone shone
(looked pre-eminent) by his majestic lustre, like the tree Pârijáta
in the midst of other heavenly trees.
7. The rows of the eyes of citizens leaving all (other) princes
fell (rested) on him, just as the black bees vacating the flower-
trees fall upon a wild scent-elephant, infuriated under the influence
of ichor.
8. Now, while the whole assembly of monarchs, sprung from
the solar and lunar races, was being glorified by bards acquainted
with the pedigrees of kings, and the fume of the burnt pith of the
fragrant aloe wood was ascending (curling up) to the flags on
high,
9. while the sound of auspicious musical instruments swelled
by the blasts of conch-shells was waxing loud and spreading all
round in the quarters of heaven, making the peacocks roosting
in the suburban gardens dance in a frantic manner,
10. the princess, who was about to elect her husband,
and who had put on apparel suited to the nuptial rite, entered
