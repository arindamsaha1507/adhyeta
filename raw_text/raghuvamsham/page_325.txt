"Canto IV. ]
(27)
12. As the moon by its power to delight is rightly called
Chandra; and as the sun by its diffusing heat is correctly named
Tapana; so he, by pleasing his subjects, was justly styled Raja.
13. Granted that his eyes were large, extending to the ears;
but the function of (real) eyes was discharged in his case by (his
knowledge of) the S'ástras, pointing out to him the minute details
of his regal duties (or the subtle purposes to be accomplished).
14. Now as he was at ease ( happy ) by the pacificatition of
(establishment of order and peace in) his king there can to
him, like a second goddess of wealth, autumn, marked by lotuses.
15. His exceedingly unbearable prowess and the intolerable
heat of the sun simultaneously pervaded all the quarters of heaven,
their path being cleared by the clouds, lightened by their contents
being discharged.
16. Indra withdrew his pluvial bow and Raghu took up his
victorious one; for they both took up their respective bows in turn
for the good of the people.
17. The (autumnal) season, with its umbrella of white lotuses
and with its chauries of the opening Kàsa flowers, imitated Raghu
with his lotus-like umbrella and his chauries resembling the bloom-
ing Kás a flowers, but could not attain his regal splendour.
18. At that time the delight of those who had eyes was of equal
flavour (or, ardour) at the sight of him with a sweet smiling face,
and of the moon of bright lustre.
19. The affluence of his fame seemed to be distributed among
the rows of geese, among the starry spheres, and in waters abound-
ing in (white) lillies.
20. Women keeping watch over the fields of paddy corn,
seated in sugar-cane shades, sang the fame of him, the protector,
springing from his merits, beginning from his heroic deeds as a boy
(or whereof a beginning was made by even children ).
21. At the rise of him sprung from a pitcher (the star of
Agastya), of great splendour, water became clear (pure and
pellucid); at that of Raghu, of great might, the heart of his enemies
apprehensive of defeat, got muddled (roiled).
22. Huge bulls with massive humps, fierce with fury and rend-
ing up (battering down) the banks of rivers, imitated the prowess
of Raghu, which had much the grace of sport."
