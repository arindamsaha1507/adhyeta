residence in the body affected by diseases, became intent on
starving himself to death.
95. Having secured a place (lit. reckoning) amongst the im-
mortals, immediately after abandoning his body at the confluence
of the Ganges and the Sarayû, and being reunited with his wife
(now) possessing a loveliness surpassing that of her former form,
be sported again in the pleasure-houses in the Nandana garden.

CANTO IX.
1. After (the death of) his father, Das'aratha, who was a
mighty warrior, who stood at the head of the self-controlled as
well as the protectors (of the people, i. e. kings) and who had
conquered (subdued) his senses by abstract contemplation, ruled
over the North Kosala after he had acquired its possession.
2. Since he, whose might (valour) was like that of Kárttikeya,
(lit. the piercer of the mountain) protected the whole kingdom (lit.
the circle of his subjects together with the citizens) now obtained
by him being the hereditary possession of his race, according to
the laws, it (i. e. the kingdom along with the subjects) became the
more attached to him (or attained a greater standard of virtue).
3. Wise men speak of ouly two (persous) as the removers of
the fatigue of those who have done their duty by timely gifts (of
rain and wealth respectively), viz. of Indra (lit. killer of Bala) and
of the king Das'aratha, a descendant of the king Manu.
4. While the son of Aja, whose prowess (lustre) was like that
of a god and who (yet) delighted in the tranquillity of mind was
the king (lord) of the Earth, no disease set its foot in the country;
whence can there be, indeed, an insult at the hands of an enemy?
The earth yielded an abundance of crops (lit. became fruit-bearing).
5. Just as the Earth maintained prosperity (or splendour) by
means of (the prowess of) Raghu who had conquered the ten quar-
ters and after him by means of Aja, so also did she shine again,
having obtained for her lord him whose valour (prowess) was
nothing short (of theirs).
6. By his impartiality, by sending down the shower of riches
(i. c. gifts of wealth) and by punishing (restraining) the wicked,
he equalled respectively Yama (the God of Death), Kubera (lit.
lord of the Yakshas) and Varuņa; and by his splendour (lustre)
he resembled the Sun."
