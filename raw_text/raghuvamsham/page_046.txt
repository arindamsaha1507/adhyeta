are the parts of the story where he has ehosen to do it; whenever
our poet has had to relate incidents in a catalogue fashion, as for
instance in Cantos XII., XV. and XVIII., he is never at his best.
But whenever he gives full play to his fancy, his poetry is as good.
as, even better than, Vâlmiki's. For example, the famous journey
back to Ayodhyá from Lanká (Canto XIII.) is to be found in
the original Rámáyaṇa also; if we compare the two we see that
our poet has excelled his predecessor in acuteness of observation
in the elegance of style and in the vividness of expression (vide
supra p. xxvii). The fourteenth Canto is rather colourless, but
the sixteenth makes up the deficiency, containing as it does
Kusa's interview with the guardian-deity of Ayodhyá, and further
on, the charming description of summer beginning with 4-
&c. (sl. 44). The next Canto (XVII.) gives a.
detailed description of administrative policy, which would probably
read dry to those not intersted in the subject. The ending Canto
describes amorous sports, much in the manner of the eighth Canto
of the Kumarasambhava. We thus see that, barring a few
exceptions, every canto of this poem has some attractive feature
or other which endears it to the reader on that account; there is
no wonder, therefore, if the whole poem has found admirers by
the million, and has become, in the words of Sanskrit rhetoricians,
af of all the Kávyas in popularity.
If we were to compare the Ragh. with the two other poems.
of Kálidása, it would be found inferior to them in unity of plot;
but, as we have remarked above, this happens because it treats of
a number of Kings and not of one definite episode. It might also
be said that the Meghadúta excels the Ragh. in perfection of
polish, though here too the comparison would be slightly unjust
since the Meghadúta is a small piece, while the Ragh. is twelve
tlmes larger; in a large work one cannot expect equal finish in.
every part.
One chief reason of Kálidása's superiority over other poets is.
his brilliantly polished style; there is no other Sanskrit post who
possesses an equal command over language so simple and withal
so graceful. In fact, all the works of Kálidasa are written in
what the later rhetoricians have called the Vaidarbhi style, the ten
chief excellences belonging to which are thus given by Dandin :-
श्लेषः प्रसादः समता माधुर्य सुकुमारता | अर्थव्यक्तिरुदारत्वमोजः कान्तिसमाधयः
(K.-D. I.41). Kálidása abhors the looseness and laxity of the opics."
