लघुशब्देन्दुशेखर, शिशुपालवध, and सारमअरी ; and ( 8 ) independently,
these works – उदारकाव्य, रघुवीरचरितकाव्य, वैद्यकल्पतरु, and वैद्यरत्नमाला. It
is possible that some of these productions belong to some other
Mallinátha thin our commentator; for there have been many
Mallinâthas, just as there have been many Kālidâsas,
The date of Mallinātha can be fixed with tolerable certainty.
He has written a com. on the Ekâvalî, a work on alamkâra which
frequently refers to King Vira-Narasimha, whose reign extended
up to 1314 A. D. Mallinâtha also often quotes the Pratâparudrîya,
another work on alamkara, which mentions King Pratâ parudra
who reigned from 1295 to 1323 A.D. Sir Dr. Bhándarkar has shown
(p. xxi of his Preface to his 2nd ed. of the Mal.-Madh.) that
Mallinâtha must be placed before the lexicographer Medinikara,
the latest limit for whose date is 1431 A. D. Hence it is clear that
the date of Mallinâtha approximately falls somewhere between 1325
and 1425 A. D. Most probably he belongs to the latter half of
the 14th century.
Mallinâtha is a commentator of great merit and literary
acumen. He was a profound grammarian, well versed in the
Nyâya and Vaiseshika philosophies, and thoroughly acquainted
with Pauranic as well as secular literature, as he himself tells us in
his introductory ślokas to the commentary on the Ragh.; and the
extreme popularity of his commentaries shows that this is not an
idle boast. His commentaries are pre-eminently adapted to the
needs of the advanced general reader. They are sufficiently ex-
pressive without being prolix. He never makes an unnecessary
display of his knowledge, but strictly follows the principle he
himself lays down, viz., a sì fstandig. He is
perhaps the only commentator on the poems of Kálidâsa who shows
a critical appreciation of poetry and endeavours to preserve, as far
as possible, the genuine readings of the poet, studiously rejecting
the spurious substitutions of single words and phrases, and the
occasional interpolations of whole ślokas. To his commentaries
on the three poems of Kálidása he has given the title ârs,
meaning thereby that his commentaries re-inspire with life the
words of Kalidasa "that lay in a swoon under the effect of the
poison of bad commentaries." Every student of Kâlidâsa now
recognizes that this was no vain presumption; Malli.'s commentaries
have eclipsed all others, and he stands uurivalled as the commentator
of Kalidasa's poetical works."
