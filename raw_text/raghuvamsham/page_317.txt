(19)
S'amî tree with fire lying concealed inside, or the river Sarasvatî
with its ( stream of) water underground.
10. He performed, in due order, the ceremonies (attendant
on pregnancy) beginning with Pumsavana, in a style worthy of
the love he bore to his beloved queen, of the loftiness of his mind,
of the vast wealth he had acquired by the might of his arms
from all quarters, and also of liis great joy.
11. Whenever the king visited her apartment he was delighted
to see how she, with tremulous glances, rose from her seat with
difficulty on account of the heaviness of the foetus with the
portions of the mighty gods (infused therein), and also experienced
languor even as she joined together her hands to make the
customary bow.
12. Now, in due season, the development of the foetus having
been effected by trusty physiciaus, well versed in the treatment of
infants, the husband saw, with a delighted mind, his beloved
queen, about to be delivered, like the sky, over-hung with clouds,
about to discharge a shower of rain at the close of summer.
13. Then she, comparable to S'achi, gave birth to a son,
whose most exalted fortune was betokened by five planets in their
(respective) ascendant high position, and not approaching the
sun, just as regal power, arising from three agencies, produces in-
exhaustible wealth.
14. The very moment the quarters brightened; and the holy
fire received the oblations with its flame turning to the right: (thus)
everything indicated auspiciousness: for the birth of persons like
him is for the good of the world.
15. Deprived of their lustre all of a sudden by the natural re-
fulgence of the well-born babe, spreading around the bed in the
lying-in-chamber, the midnight lamps became as if they were
painted in a picture.
16. To the attendants of the inner apartments announcing the
birth of a son, in words which rivalled nectar in sweetness, there
were only three things which the king could not give, viz. his
(imperial) umbrella bright as the moon, and, the two chauries
(being the insignia of royalty ).
17. As the king was looking intently at ( lit. drinking in ) the
lovely face of his son, with an eye as steady as a lotus in a breeze-"
