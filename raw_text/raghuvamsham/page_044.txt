"XXXII
a striking description of the main parts of the country; it is
impossible to forget the word-pictures which the poet draws in
such stanzas 48 बलेरन्युषितास्तस्य विजिगोषोर्गताध्वनः | मारीचोद्भ्रान्तहारीता
मलयाद्रेरुपत्यकाः ॥ or विनीताध्वश्रमास्तस्य सिन्धुतीरवि चेटनेः । दुधुवुर्बाजिनः
disobgakuci || Canto V. describes the magnanimity of Raghn,
who gave to the sage Kautsa wealth in excess of his demands;
it is, as we have said elsewhere, probably the most characteristic
kingly trait. This Canto contains also the famous address of the
bards (Vaitâlikas) to prince Aja at dawn. The passage from
aga: (V. 63) to the end of the Canto is one of the
best known in the works of Kalidasa, where the poet has expressed
beautiful thoughts in language which is most rhythmical and
charming. The expression here is so sweet and so pleasing, the
harmony between sound and sense is carried here to such exquisite
perfection, that it is not without reason that a tradition has grown
up around this passage as to its having been written by the
Muse of Poetry, the goddess Sarasvatî herself! The sixth Canto
contains rapid pen-portraits of the various kings in the Svayam-
vara; here Kálidása reveals himself as a master of the art of
sketching a character with a few telling strokes. The seventh
Canto contains a description of a typical Aryan wedding, similar
to the one in the seventh Canto of the Kum., and the student can
see that the marriage-customs have not much altered materially
during twenty centuries. The description of the fight (VII. 35-
63), it must be allowed, is rather tame and conventional. The
eighth Canto contains the famous 3 or lament of King
Aja at the death of his wife Indumatî. It is fine poetry, but it
suffers by comparison with the corresponding in Kum.
IV. It is more natural in a woman, as being of the weaker sex,
to indulge in lamentation; while when a man grieves it is a sign
of weakness which does not enlist our sympathy so much: the
poet has therefore better succeeded in portraying a lamenting Rati.
At the end of this Canto is the beautiful message sent to Aja by
his guru Vasishtha, concerning the evanescence of this world and
the futility of human sorrow for departed relatives. The ninth
Oanto attracts many owing to the charming 3 introduced.
This is the only place in all the works of Kalidása where he tries
his hand at f; he has succeeded well without putting an
undue strain on the construction of the s'loka, as other inferior
poets do when they try to employ यमकs.
The Canto also contains
fine descriptions of spring and deer-hunt."
