Kalidasa which establishes his undisputed claim to the highes
honour which is thus bestowed upon him?' Unless this question is
satisfactorily answered Kâlidâsa's merits as a poet cannot be cald
to be determined. His poetic genius has brought Sanskrit poetry
to the highest elegance and refinement. His style is peculiarly
pure and chaste. It has 'neither the laxity of the Paranas nor the
extravagant colouring of later poems.' It is unartificial and
characterized by brevity consistent with perspicuity. An unaffected
simplicity of expression and an easy-flowing language mark his
writings which are embellished with similes unparalleled for their
beauty and appropriateness, and with pithy general sayings. His.
diction is marked by the absence of long compounds, involved con-
structions, over-wrought rhetoric, and artificial puns. Kalidasa excels
other poets in his description of the sublime and the beautiful. It is
a principle recognized by all modern critics that 'Nature must be the
life and essence of poetry'; and in respect of this, Kâlidasa may be
said to be essentially a poet of Nature (of course in the limited
sense of the term which it is possible to attach to it in those times
of gay luxury and general prosperity). He describes with most
effective touches the gorgeous scenery of the mountain Himálaya-
its snow-clad and mineral-covered summits, the peaks where sunshine
ever reigns, the fragrant and cool breezes blowing there, the wilds
with the hunters, the musk-deer, the potent herbs shedding lustre
at night, the chamara deer, the Mânasa lake &c.; and his description.
of the Ganges and the peaceful hermitage-life is very striking and
life-like. His descriptive powers are great, and some of the scenes
in the Sák, the Megh., and the Ragb, are so enchanting as to hold
his readers spell-bound. And as regards , the kind of
poetry which suggests more than what it expresses, he is a master of
acknowledged skill.
(B) HIS DATE.
The problem of the date of Kâlidâsa is a vexed one and it has
yet to be finally settled. The earliest mention of Kâlidâsa by name
is in the Aihole Inscription dated 634 A, D., and it furnishes the
7th Century A. D. as the downward limit of the poet's date.
Tradition mentions Kálidasa as a contemporary and a court-post of
king Vikramaditya. One king of that name founded the era known
after him, which is accepted as commencing with 57 B. O. Some
antiquarians once did not accept this date as the correct one, but
16 For this the student is referred to pp. 27-29 of our Introduction
to the S'akuntala, 5th ed."
