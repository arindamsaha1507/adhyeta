S1. 40 परस्पराक्षिसादृश्यम् - अक्ष्णोः सादृश्यमक्षिसादृश्यम् | By 'कर्मव्यतिहारे
darà ta' 'Darnadagok' (Va'rtikas on Páp. VIII. 1. 12), & -
pronoun is always doubled and in many cases compounded (i. e. the
case-termination of the first member may be dropped and the two
words joined together as in a comp.) to express interchange of
action. To express the interchange of action here we must have
परस्य परस्य अक्षिसाहश्यम् | But comp. is not allowed in the case of पर
and अन्य, as remarked by Bhattoji Dikshita ( बहुलग्रहणादन्यपरयोर्न
समासवत् ). Then by the Vārt. 'असमासवद्भावे पूर्वपदस्थस्य सुपः सुर्वक्तव्यः
when uncompounded, the case-term. of the first word is changed to
, the term. of the nom. sing.; so we have q: and by the rule
' ' (see Gr. § 43 d) we have
Now compound-
ing this with अक्षिसादृश्यम् We get परस्पराक्षिसादृश्यम् | But here another
difficulty arises. Since qr becomes the first member of the -
new comp. of the first q must be dropped by the general rule:
Bhattoji Dîk. therefore, regards this as an irregularity (gida.
). See Sid.-Kau. on Pán. VIII. 1. 12.

easily inspired confidence in the herds of the deer. Vide II. 11.
S1. 41. तोरणस्रजम् - सृज्यते इति सृजन्तीति वा स्रुक् lit. 'that which is
made or that which people make easily;' and as nothing is made
more easily, and charms more when made, than a garland, it means -
a garlaud. तोरणम् - तुरन्त्यत्रेति, स्तुवन्ति रणन्त्यत्रेति वा where people.
gather with exclamations of joy; or
where.
people go in haste for auspicious purposes. TT usually means
the outer gate of a palace or city, or an arched doorway. It also
means 'a temporary ornamental arch,' which is the meaning here:
When kings and other great personages go out on a tour it is
customary for people to exhibit their joy by raising ornamental
arches with garlands suspended over them and the cranes here,
as it were, did the same.
As for Mallinâtha's remark

&c. are omitted, the उत्प्रेक्षा is called गम्या, व्यङ्गचा or प्रतीयमाना.
