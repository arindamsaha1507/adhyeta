$1. 70. :-This epithet is very significant. It implies.
neglect ( unintentional though it be) on the part of Vasishtha,
since he has the power to bless the king with progeny. See Malli,
and notes on I. 35. सिक्तं स्वयमित्र &c. - वृक्षकं, अनुकम्पितो वृक्षः वृक्षकः.
The simile is very appropriate here as being drawn from the
daily scenes of life and therefore perfectly familiar to sages.
The Rishis considered the trees of the hermitage as their children.
(see V. 6) and so the king could very well rouse the mercy
of Vasishtha by comparing himself to a tree reared up by the sage
but bearing no fruit.
-properly an epithet of the Supreme Being. It
means 'one who possesses all kinds of excellences.' Jeden Baden
धर्नस्य यशसः श्रियः । वैराग्यस्याथ मोक्षस्य षण्णा भग इतीरणा ॥ ( भगो विद्यते अस्य

Huenda 1. HR-'the last debt', i.e. the debt due to the ancestors.
According to the Hindu S'âstras, everyone that is born has three
debts to pay off, viz. to sages, to gods and to the departed forefa-
thers. He frees himself from these respectively by studying the
Vedas, offering the daily and other sacrificies, and by having a son.
Cf. VIII. 30 and the S'ruti quoted by Malli. in his com. ad loc.
-fr. 3+; for the change of to see Pân. VI. 3.
67. आलानम्-
-Here Malli. is quite right in understanding by
the post to which an elephant is tied and not a chain or rope, as.
some would have it. That the simile should be quite appropriate,
must mean something that inflicts mental, and not actual
bodily pain. The elephant would be as glad to enjoy a cool bath
with a chain round his neck as without one. Cf. 'ý a azginooi-
Aîù vigifas eungîa¶ fêùz:' XIV. 38. That the force of the simile
should be fully understood, construe: (1) 3-af-
णस्य दन्तिनः अरुन्तुदमालानमिव असह्यपीडम् अवेहि, or (2) असह्यपीडं मे अन्त्यम्
ऋणम् अनिर्वाणस्य दन्तिनः अरुन्तुदम् आलानमिव अवेहि ।

T: the aff. (in the com. is probably an (oversight) be-
ing dropped when the word is used in the plural and not
in the fem.; see Pân. II. 4. 62. Ikshvâku was the son of
Vaivasvata Manu and father of Vikukshi. He was the first king
of the solar dynasty in Ayodhyâ. He was born from the nostril
of Manu, as he happened to sneeze. Cf. Bhág.-P. adig ¤âšş
