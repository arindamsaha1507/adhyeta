formally or owned King of Ayodhyâ with due pomp and ceremony.
He then gives the armies of Sugriva and Vibbishana leave to
depart, and restores Pushpaka to its original rightful owner,
Kubera, In course of time Sîtà shows signs of pregnancy.
She expresses a desire again to visit the once-familiar regions
along the banks of the Ganges. While Ráma promises her that,
a scandal reaches his ear about his unquestioning acceptance of
Sitâ after her residence in a stranger's house for a long time.
A strong sense of duty towards his subjects both as the
dispenser of law and justice and the up-holder of social order,
compels him to abandon Sîtá as a concession to this scandal,
although he knew her to be pure and innocent. He, therefore,
orders Lakshmaṇa to take Sîtâ away and leave her on the banks
of the Ganges near the hermitage of Valmiki who, he thinks,
would find her and take due care of her. Lakshmana very
reluctantly performs this task; and when Sîtâ knows why
she is abandoned, she cries loud and long, though she would
not blame Râma so much as she blamed herself. Vâlmîki takes
her to his hermitage where afterwards in due time she gives
birth to twins. Râma continues to discharge his kingly duties
as usual, but without marrying again.
CANTO XV. Now, certain sages who were harassed by the
demon Lavaṇa apply to Râma for protection, who sends off
Satrughna on that mission. Satrughna happens to halt at
Valmiki's hermitage on his way, and it so chances that that very
night Sîtâ gives birth to twins. Satrughna proceeds against
Lavaṇa, whom he killes in battle, and builds for himself a city called
Madhurá on the banks of the Yamunâ.
Sîtâ's sons were named
Kus'a and Lava; they were duly brought up and educated by
the venerable Vālmîki, who also teaches them to sing his own poem
Rāmāyaṇa', celebrating the exploits of their father. After some
time Satrughna returns to Ayodhya, but says nothing to Ráma
about Kus'a and Lava, at the express bidding of Valmiki, who
bided his own time. Rama's killing of Sambûka is then related.
Sambûka was a Sûdra practising penance; this was against the
rule, and this transgression caused other distresses in the state;
it was therefore imperative that Sambûka should be killed.
This done, Râma performs a horse-sacrifice, to which holy men
are invited from everywhere. Among them is Valmiki, who
brings with him his two pupils, the princes Kusa and Lava,"
