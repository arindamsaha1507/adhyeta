"CANTO III.
1. After that (conception ) Sudakshin칙 bore the evidence
(signs) of pregnancy, which was (as it were,) the very desire of
her husband, with its fulfilment approached, which was (as
gladdening to the eyes of her female friends as the appearance of
the moon-light, and which was again the cause of the perpetua-
tion of Ikshv치ku's race.
2. Not wearing all her ornaments on account of the attenuation
of her body and with her face pale like the lodhra flower, she
looked like the night bordering on dawn, with but a few stars dis-
played therein) and marked by the moon shining dimly.
3. The king smelling, in private, her mouth fragrant with clay
(that she would eat ), never felt satisfaction, like an elephant
smelling a small pond in a forest tract, sprinkled over with drops
from the clouds, at the close of summer.
4. Her (future) son was to enjoy (the sovereignty of) the
earth with his (conquering) chariot stopping only at the
extremities of the quarters, as the lord of the gods enjoys that of

object of that kind (clay) in preference to all other objects of taste.

me her wish; what are the things that she has a craving for ?"
thus did the lord of the North-Kosalas constantly ask his wife's
companions in loving concern.
6. Having reached the state painful on account of hankerings
of pregnancy, whatever she asked for, she saw brought to her ;
for there was nothing, which being desired by him, was unattain -
able to him, who had his bow strung, even if it were in heaven.
7. Gradually getting over the painful state of pregnancy-
cravings, she appeared beautiful, as her limbs grew plump, like
a creeper, which after the fall of the old leaves, is dressed in lovely
foliage.
8. As days rolled on, her two breasts, growing exceedingly
plump, and with nipples black all round, far surpassed the love-
liness of a couple of well-formed lotus-buds with black bees per-
ched upon them.
9. The monarch regarded the queen with child, as if she
were the sea-girt earth holding within a hiddden treasure, or the"
