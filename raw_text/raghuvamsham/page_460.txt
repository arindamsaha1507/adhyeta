[ Canto III.
cf. I. 58,76, 10,44; V. 7. 11, 45 &c. For parallel passages see ft.-
note. हि - may also be taken in the sense of अवधारण, प्रसीदत्येव. वस्तु-
the proper material; a fit object.
81. 30. ::-The following qualities of the intellect are
enumerated in the s'l. quoted by Malli. from Kåm.-(1) Desire to
hear, hence earnest desire for knowledge; (2) Attention; (3) Com-
prehension or proper understanding; (4) Retention; (5) Ratiocination
or consideration of the pros and cons; (6) Grasping the correct
sense and (7) Knowledge of truth or correct knowledge. Or 3

the qualities of . : far:-seo Sanj. and note to I. 23.
चतुरर्णवोपमाः—&n instance of त्रिपदबहुव्रीहि. This indiestes the immen-
sity of the four lores. पवनातिपातिभिः- पवनमतिलध्य पतितुं शीलमेषामिति
:, qualifies : and go. The qualities of Raghu's
intellect penetrating the various regions of thought, with a rapidity
unknown to the wind, and the horses of the sun journeying through
the sky with an enormous velocity, are fitly compared with each
other. It should also be noted that the sun has seven horses and
the qualities are also seven. The sun's horses bear him through the
four regions of space; and the qualities of Raghu's intellect carried
him through the four lores. The sa here is this:-As the sun
moves lighting up places where his rays penetrate, so Raghu by
virtue of his keen intellect threw light on many an obscure passage
in the S'ástras.
