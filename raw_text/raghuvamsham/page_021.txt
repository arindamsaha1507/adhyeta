preceded or followed him, is natural enough; but he has evoked
spontaneous outpourings of praise and manifestations of admiration
even from foreign scholars and poets who had access to his works
either directly or through translations. Goethe has voluntarily
bestowed the highest meed of praise on him so much was he
enraptured by the charms of Kâlidâsa's Muse and struck with his
poetic genius. This is what he says about the Sákuntala-
"Wouldst thou the young year's blossoms and the fruits of
its decline,
And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured, feasted,
fed ?
Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself in one sole name
combine?
I name thee, O Śakuntalâ, and all at once is said." 15

When we remember that Goethe himself was the greatest poet
of Germany and one of the greatest of the world, we realize the
importance of his estimate of our poet. The well-known philosopher
and traveller, Humboldt, pronounces the following judgment-
"Kâlidása is a masterly describer of the influence which Nature
exercises upon the minds of lovers. Tenderness in the expression
of feelings and richness of creative fancy have assigned to
him his lofty place among the poets of all nations."
celebrated critic, Schlegel, has assigned him a very high position
amongst the glorious company of the Sons of Song'. Several
eminent modern orientalists have also offered their tribute of praise
to our Indian Shakespeare, as Sir William Jones was the first to
call him the very comparison of Kâlidâsa to Shakespeare is the
highest form of eulogy that could be bestowed upon him by foreign
critics. Sir Monier-Williams, while writing about the Sâkuntala,
thus expresses himself :-"No composition of Kàlidása displays
more the richness of his poetical geniue, the exuberance of his
imagination, the warmth and play of his fancy, his profound
knowledge of the human heart, his delicate appreciation of its most
refined and tender emotions, his familiarity with the workings and
counter-workings of its conflicting feelings-in short more entitles
him to rank as the Shakespeare of India. " Prof. Lassen calls him
"the brightest star in the firmament of Indian poetry.

We thus find that Kâlidâsa has established his sovereignty in
the hearts of all alike. Now it may be asked, 'What is that in
