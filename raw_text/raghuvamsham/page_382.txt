"(84)
[Canto X.
47. You shall loosen the braids of hair of the captive damsels:
of heaven undefiled by the forcible seizure of their hair by
Ràvana restrained (from such an act) by the curse."
48. Having, in this way,'drenched with the water (in the form)
of speeh the crop-like gods withered (dried) by the drought of
Rávana, the cloud-like Krishna (Vishnu) disappeared.
49. The gods, Indra and others, followed Vishnu, bent
on doing (or, engaged in) the work of the gods, with their
portions, as trees follow the wind with (their) flowers.
50. Then, at the conclusion of the sacrifice performed with an
object in view (viz. the attainment of a son) by the king, a Being
arose out of the fire along with (to) the astonishment of the
officiating priests.
51. He held in his hands rice boiled with milk placed in a
vessel of gold, which was difficult to be borne even by him on
account of the entrace of the Primeval Being (Vishnu) into it.
52. The king accepted the food which was offered by that
Being of (connected with) Prajâpati, just as Indra did the essence
of the waters (Amrita), laid bare (manifested) by the ocean.
53. That the merits of that king were such as were unattain-
able by others was declared by the fact that even He, the source
of the three worlds, desired to be his progeny.
54. He divided the energy of Vishuu designated as (in the
form of) the sacrifical food between his two wives, just as the
of day (the Sun) divides the morning sunshine between the
Sky and the Earth.
55. Kausalyâ was respected by bim and Kaikeyî was his be-
loved (or favourite). He, therefore, wished that Sumitrà should
be honoured by them (by giving her a portion thereof).
56. The two wives of the king, knowing the mind (divining
the wish) of their husband, who was possessed
of great
knowledge, gave (each) a half of their share of the Charu to her.
57. She (Sumitrà) too had (equal) affection for both co-
wives just as the female bee, is (equally) fond of both the
streaks (z. e. on both the sides) of the exuding rut of an elephant.
58. A fœtus, grown out of Supreme Being, was borne by them
for the prosperity of the people, as is a watery embryo by solar
rays, called Amritás.
59. They (the queens), who became big with child at one and
the same time and whose complexion had grown a little pale,
appeared like the luxuriant crops with the appearance of the
fruits hidden within.
60. They all saw in dreams that they were guarded by dwarfs
whose bodies were marked with conches, swords, maces, S'àrgia
bows and discs."
