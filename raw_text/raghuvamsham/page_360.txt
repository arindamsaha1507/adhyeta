[Canto VIII.
15. That illustrious (royal) family, with the old king leading
a life of spiritual tranquility, and the new king just entered upon
his kingly career, was comparable to the sky with the moon al-
most set and the sun newly risen.
16. Raghu and his son, bearing (respectively) the emblems of
the ascetic and the king, seemed to the people like the portions
of the two dharmas (duties), come down to the earth, whose re-
wards are final emancipation and earthly glory.
17. For the acquisition of what was (yet) unconquered, Aja
took for his companions ministers well-versed in politics; while
Raghu, in order to reach the state which is not subject to decay
(salvation), associated himself with contemplative ascetics who
had got true insight into Yoga and who ever spoke the truth.
18. The youthful king took his judgment seat in order to look
into (the affairs of) his subjects; while the aged monarch seated
himself, in solitude, on the holy seat of the Kus'a grass in order to
practise the abstract concentration of the mind.
19. The one (Aja) by the super-eminence of his sovereign
power reduced to submission the neighbouring princes; while the
other (Raghu) by virtue of his constant metaphysical exercises
brought under his control the five vital airs existing in the body.
20. The new king completely foiled the efforts (lit. reduced to
ashes the fruits of the undertakings) of his enemies; while the
old one engaged himself in burning down (i. e. completely an-
nihilating), by means of the fire of knowledge, the fruits of his
own actions.
21. Aja employed the six expedients beginning with peace,
with a due regard to their results; Raghu, on his part, who re-
garded gold and a clod of earth as equal, established his mastery
over the three primary principles, the constituents of Prakrti.
22. The new lord, steady in action, did never desist from his
undertakings until they bore fruit; nor did the lord other than the
new one, firm in mind, desist from the practice of holy medita-
tion, until he obtained a vision of the Supreme Spirit.
23. Thus the two (Aja and Raghu), who were watchful of the
enemies and senses (respectively) whose course was checked, and
who were bent on (attaining) prosperity and absolution, obtained
their (respective) desired objects (lit. obtained the complete
attainment of their desired objects)."
