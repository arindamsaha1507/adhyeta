it ends at present.
All the commentators, again, who belong to
different provinces of the land and different periods of time, seem to
have believed the poem to be complete, and they all conclude their
commentaries formally at the end of the nineteenth Canto; and
one of them, Hemádri, incidentally remarks at the beginning of
the 16th Canto that the Rámáyana, the poet's source for the history
up to that portion, being exhausted, he now gives four more Cantos
from other sources. There is a persistent tradition, however,
which says that the complete poem originally contained as many
as 25 Cantos; and there is nothing that goes against this tradition.
On the contrary many things tend to confirm it. As a general
rule Sanskrit poets studionsly avoid a tragic result; and even when
they cannot avoid it, they are anxious to give it an agreeable finish.
And we cannot reasonably suppose Kálidása to have gone against
a practice of such long standing as led the later writers on poetics
to lay down a rule that the death of the hero should never be
actually represented ( D.-R. III. 40). "Further"
remarks Mr. S. P. Pandit, "he (Kâlidâsa), who is on all hands-
praised for the happy choice of his subjects and the thorough
execution of his plans, cannot be supposed to have brought down
the history of the most celebrated ancient Indian kings to such
a sorry end. It is natural to imagine that his object must have
been some such as to connect me ne of the dyna of kings
existing in his time with the race anciently descended from the
sun. The Vishnu-Purána enumerates no less than 37 princes
after Agnivarna, of whom it represents 8 as having reigned up
to the war of the Mahabharata and the rest after that event *
*
*
* The line of Kings, therefore, mentioned by our
poet, not being complete, the conclusion is inevitable either that
the poet did not finish his work, or if he did, it has not descended
to us in its entirety." The absence of any trace of additional
Cantos having ever existed lends weight to the former conclusion.
We think it highly likely that Kálidása, though he might have
intended to write more Oantos, was somehow prevented from
carrying out his intention.
Another feature, that calls for notice on a review of the
contents of the poem as a whole, is the evident lack of unity of
plot. This, however, is part of the very design of the poem,
and can hardly be accounted as a blemish. The poet did not choose
a single episode, nor even the life of a single hero; but the lives
of a number of famous kings; it is unfair to expect unity of plot."
