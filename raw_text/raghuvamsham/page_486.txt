[ Canto IV.
is probably the ancient name representing the aboriginal tribes of
the country. It is mentioned in the Mâhâbbârata among the Indian
provinces along with Videha aud Támralipta and in the list of the
southern conquests of Sahadeva. In the Brih. Sam., however, it is
mentioned as a different country from Udra. The chief town of this
province 'Cuttak' is said to have been founded by Nripakesari in the
tenth century. It was probably better known as Padmávatî. Jaipur
(Yajnapura) on the borders of the Balsor (Bales'vara) district, and
the city of the celebrated temple of Bhuvaneshvara in the Purf
district, are said to be the older capitals of the district. The most
important place, however, from a Hindoo point of view, is the
town of Puri, the site of the far-famed temple of Jagannatha. Its
celebrity, however, dates from comparatively recent times, as no
notice of it is found in the Mahábbárata or the earliar Purâņas.
उत्कलादर्शितपथः - This shows that the Utkalas easily yeilded
to Raghu and assisted him in his passage towards Kalinga.
ge: The country of Kalinga lay to the south of Odra
and extended to the mouths of the Godávarî. In the time
of the Mah. Bhár. it seems to have included Odra, as the river
Vaitaranî, which runs by Jaipur, is clearly stated in one place to be
in Kalinga. It did not generally extend beyond the Godavári, as its
mouths are mentioned to have been in the possession of the A'ndh-
ras. According to Dandin its capital Kalinganagara was at some
distance from the sea-coast, inasmuch as he says that the king of
Kalinga went out to pass some days at the seaside, when he was
taken captive with his daughter by the king of A'ndhra (see Dk.
Ull. 7). The capital was, therefore, not at Kalingapattana, on
the north, nor probably at Vizagapattam (Vijayapattana) but at
Rájamahendri on the south, as it is at some distance from the sea
and borders on A'ndhra-desa. The Kalingas are described as
having sprung from Kalinga, the son of Dîrghatamas, and his
wife Sudeshna. It is thus described in the Tantras-arungfund
गङ्गांतीरान्तगः शिवे । कलिङ्गदेशः संप्रोक्तो वाममार्गपरायणः ॥
S'l. 39.
-This may mean by up the lord of Mahendra
or the mountain itself, since the humiliation suffered by the moun,
tain was also suffered by its lord. By Mahendra is meant the
chain of mountains that extends from Utkala or Orissa and the
Northern Circars to Gond-vana. See Wilson's Vish. P. p. 174. It
is one of the seven principal mountain chains of India. Genera
