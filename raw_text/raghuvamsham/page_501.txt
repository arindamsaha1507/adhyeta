it has its technical meaning here, viz. a panegyric song begin-
ning with such words as af &c., full of alliteration and composed
in the Mâlini or other similar metre, &c. See Pratáparudra quoted
in the foot-note. fæacız-síðar a: a Nityasamâss. They are so
called because they have a deformed body-the face of a horse with a
human body. See Wilson's Vish. P. Vol. I, pp. 82, 87.

According to some
S′1. 79. परस्परेण -परेण परेणात परस्परेण. By the rule ‘मतिबुद्धिपूजार्थे-
' the affixa is added in the sense of the present tense. And when
so added it governs the Gen, case. Following this reasoning, many
commentators adopt the reading area. But there seems to be no
necessity for changing the reading. The rule alluded to above does
not always prevent the a from being added in the past tense; e. g.
gaat 4: guêt: 1 We have for this. See Pán. IV.
8. 115. उपायनपाणिषु - उपायनानि पाणिषु येषां तेषु । Malli. dissolves &s
उपायनयुक्ताः पाणयो येषां probably to avoid the application of the rule
' सप्तमीविशेषणे बहुव्रीहौ' forgetting that पाणि is treated as an exception
in the Bháshya. :-(1) riches; (2) power.
S'1. 80. अक्षोभ्यम् - क्षोभमनर्हः अक्षोभ्यः not to be shaken off i. e.
imperishable. पौलस्त्य - पुलस्त्यस्य गोत्रापत्यं पुमान् । This alludes to the
story of Rávana's lifting up the mountain Kailása. Once while
Rávaṇa was passing in his aerial car (called Pushpaka) which he had
taken by force from Kubera, its motion was suddenly arrested as he
approached that part of the mountain Kailása where lived Siva and
Párvatî. He was told by Nandî to leave the mountain. But Rávana
in anger uplifted it with his arms. Thereupon SŚiva pressed the
mountain with the little finger of his left foot and compelled Rávaṇa
to relinquish his hold upon the mountain. See Râm. Utt. K.
aga &c.-Here the poet gives the reason why the mountain
had to be ashamed of itself. Raghu thought it beneath his dignity
to advance against Kailâsa as the mountain was once overcome by
Rávana who was a Bráhmana, and therefore was not worthy of his
superior prowess as a Kshatriya."
