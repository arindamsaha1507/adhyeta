"then consult the translation given at the end. Besides the translation,
the present edition gives copious explanatory notes on each S'loka,.
explains the compounds, notes peculiarities of grammar and discusses the
propriety of different readings where necessary. Certain important
points not noticed by Mallinâtha are also considered herein. Allusions
to mythology and history are explained, important etymologies given and
the ancient geographical names of rivers, countries, &c. identified with
their present names. Figures of speech are 'given and rhetorical discus-
sions introduced where necessary. The definitions and schemes of all
the metres used by the poet in this work are given, and model questions,
as well as those set at the Bombay University examinations, are appended
at the end. In short, an endeavour has been made to meet every possible
difficulty of students, and no pains have been spared to make this famous
pocmn easily intelligible even to an ordinary student.
PREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION.
In this edition, while I have retained all the original features of the
work, the whole has been submitted to a thorough revision, and it is
hoped that in this form it will prove increasingly useful to those for whom
it is intended. The introduction has been recast and re-written in part,
and considerable additions made to the English notes. I am obliged to
the editions of Messrs. Pandit, Nandargikar, and Ray, to whom my best
thanks are due.
Bombay, June 1922.
