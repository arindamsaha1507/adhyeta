( 21 )
generated by the contact of his body, the king, with his eyes closed
at the corners, experienced the deliciousness of the touch of a
son, after a long time (i. e. a loug period of disappointment ), or
for a long time (or, came to the state of knowing-became conscious
of the pleasure of the touch of his son after a long time-so much
benumbed with joy he was).
27. And he, no transgressor of the prescribed bounds, consider-
ed his line as well perpetuated by him ( his son) of exalted birth,
a different form of his own person and the possessor of the foremost
of merits, just as Brahmá (lit. the lord of creation) considers
his own creation well preserved by that other form of his own self
(Vishnu ) working in combination with Satva, the best of the
three qualities (that govern the world.)

the excellences of intellect, got across (mastered), in succession,
the four lores, comparable in vastness to the four oceans, as the
lord of the directions (the sun) traverses the four quarters by
means of his bay steeds, surpassing the wind in velocity.
31. Having put on the holy skin of the ruru ( a kind of deer)
he learnt the art of using missiles, together with their incantations,
from his father himself; for not only was his sire the sole sovereign
on earth, but the sole archer also.
32. Like a young calf reaching the state of a full-grown bull,
and the young elephant attaining the condition of a huge elephant,
Raghu, whose childhood was gradually supplanted by youth,
developed a frame charming by its gravity ( dignity).
33. Then after the ceremony of the cutting of the hair had been
performed, his father performed the marriage rite, and the"
