( 241 )
According to Hem बालातपः means कन्याराशिस्थितः सूर्यः तस्य निभा ( नितर
भा bright light ) सैवांशुकं यस्य प्रारम्भ – (1) Those who make the
great effort'. i. e. to know the Eternal one; a Yogin.

10. -Lit. the favourite of, or abode of, Lakshmi;
hence probably originally an ornament worn on the breast; an auspi-
cious mark, according to some a curl of hair, on the breast of Vishnu.
The Purâņas account for it differently. According to the Mahâbhâ-
rata, S'antiparva, when S'iva destroyed the sacrifice of Daksha, the
S'ula he had created for that purpose, went to the mountain Gandha-
mádana, where Nara and Nârâyana were practising penance,
and
struck the breast of the latter. It was then sent back with a Hun-
kara to S'iva, who in consequence came thither and a tumultous.
fight took place between S'iva and Nâráyana. The two deities,
however, were reconciled after a while and Náráyana said to S'iva:
- अद्यप्रभृति श्रीवत्सः शूलाङ्को मे भवत्वयं । मम पाण्यांकितश्चापि श्रीकण्ठस्त्वं
भविष्यसि ॥ The Bhág. relates a different story; cf. Sk. X Uttar.

obtained from the churned ocean and worn by Vishnu on his bosom.

and notes on VI. 6; one of the five trees of Indra's garden and a
Kalpa tree. It was produced at the churning of the ocean, being.
the ornament of heaven and the pride of S'achi, perfuming the
world with its blossoms. See Bhág. P. VIII. 8.

araf: The arms of Vishnu (see s'l. 60) are here represented:
as deities attending upon their lord. cf सुदर्शनादिभिः स्वास्त्रमूर्तिमद्भिरुपा-
fai (ag¤ ) | Bhag. P. VIII. 6. 7. Jaîífa-see supra II. 9. The
weapons given to Rama by Vis'vámitra are similarly spoken of as
deities attending upon Ráma. Cf. Bál. Râmâ. 27. Uttar. V. 13,.
14. and Mah. I. 42-46.
