poet's own words - क्षतास्किल त्रायत इत्युदन: क्षत्रस्य शब्दो भुवनेषु रूढः ।
राज्येन किं तद्विपरीतवृत्तेः प्राणैरुपक्रोशमलीमसैर्वा ॥ . "The highest duty
of the ruler is to look after the weak and to save them from the
aggressive strong." In due time, when his son Raghu is born,
he abdicates his throne in his favour, and retires to the forest
Raghu is the next king. He was the most illustrious of his
line, since not only is the poem named "Raghu-vamsa" after him,
but even his equally illustrious successor, Râma, is more often
known by such titles as राघव, रघुपति, रघुनाथ and the like. While
yet a young man, Raghu was entrusted with the task of guarding
his father's sacrificial horse; we know how he had to fight with..
the redoubtable Indra, the chief of the immortals. His intrepid
bravery won him Indra's admiration and his father's blessing.
In the poet's own words, the incident brings out Raghu's
framfag (III. 62). Raghu's merits as a ruler will be found in-
ślokas 8-13 of canto IV., which also describes how Raghu brought
the whole of India under his sway. It would appear that he was
the first prince of his race who undertook, and brought to a
successful termination, this wide, arduous and glorious campaign of
universal conquest; and that is perhaps one reason why he came
to be regarded as the greatest of his race, since doubtless a king
who first brought a whole country under one chhattra could not
have failed to win universal applause and approbation. It is, however.
in a subsequent incident that his crowning achievement lies, whicl
brought him undying 25 fame. Having given away all his wealth as -
gift to Bráhmaṇas in a sacrifice, Raghu had practically become a
beggar, so much so that even the vessels in his household were
earthen and not of gold. But when the sage Kautsa comes to him for
money he cannot turn him away; he wishes to satisfy his want; and
the God of Wealth showers down gold, all of which he makes over
to Kautsa. It is more than Kautsa wants, but the king insists on
his taking all, as it was obtained for him; as the poet beautifully
expresses it — जनस्य साकेतनिवासिनस्तौ द्वावण्यभूतामभिनन्द्यसत्त्वौ । गुरुप्रदेया-
धिकनिःस्पृहोऽर्थी नृगेऽर्थिकामादधिकपदश्व ॥ ( V. 31 ).

25 That this was also the popular conception is shown by a later
reference to Raghu, when in canto VI. he is described as affenta:
