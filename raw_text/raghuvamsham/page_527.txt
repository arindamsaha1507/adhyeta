Vrittikâra who supposes 3 to be the word used in the Sútra. He
is followed by Bhaṭṭoji, and Jñánendra Bhikshu. Patañjali gives
this Sútra. Nâges'abhatta, however, differs and
to be the correct form., being obtained by the
rule à f'] Kâli. uses both the forms. Cf. fajín.
भिरुत्थितानि' VI. 33; 'यूथं तदग्रसरगर्वितकृष्णसारम्' 'सवरुणावरुणाग्रसरं रुचा' IX.
55, 61. Amara gives the form . This question is discussed
by Hem, and Chár. for which see ft.-note. - is to be
pronounced with a (intonation) and ar expresses fr
उच्छिनत्ति would your father destroy the foes; नैवोच्छिनात्ते no; certainly
he would not. Cf. 4€ arsyſaczepotaggi faùar' › Śák. VII. 4.
The idea here is this-Aruņa destroys the enemy of the sun (i. e.
darkness) only so long as he himself has not taken up the work of
destruction. So your father would destroy your enemies only so long
as you are not able to take care of yourself. But now you are able
(f) to take the lead in the battle, so get up and chase your
enemies if there be any). Prof. Ray thinks that the enemies here
referred to are the morning breeze, the dew drops, the lotuses, &c.,
which are poetically spoken of as the stealers of Aja's Lakshmi.

@zgjat
&c-According to Kaiyata, quoted by Malli.,
the word 3 appearing first in a Comp. always takes the Tad, affix
अयच् (अय ), i. e. becomes उभय, as indiested by the word 'नित्यम्'
in the Sūtra 'उभादुदात्तो नित्यम्' । स्तम्बेरमाः - स्तम्ब & clump of grass.
See com. मुखर . -निन्दितं मुखमस्य। मुखशब्दो लक्षणयात्र वचनपरः | one who
has to say something on every topic; garrulous; or
Trafa; noisy. Here of course it means 'resounding.'
शृङ्खल – शृङ्गैः
शिआनो वा स्खलतीति | In either case it is of the पृषोदसाद class.
-the newly risen sun (giving reddish light). Cf. arr
वसाना तरुणार्करागं Kum. III. 54. भिन्नाद्रि० - गिरौ भवं गैरिकं (fr. गिरि + टळू
.;. e. 57 ) a reddish brown mineral; îít¬og'ı azı: Iftar: a comp. of
the शाकपार्थिव clas3. अद्वे: गैरिकतटा अद्रि०; भिन्ना अद्विगैरिकतटा यैस्ते.
:-bud-like, i. e. beautiful tusks (Malli.).
S'l. 73. &c.-shows that Aja had a large number of
.horses with him. वनजाक्ष बने जायते इति वनजं; वनजे इव अक्षिणी यस्य
स वनजाक्षः वनायुदेश्याः – बनायुः देशः तत्र भवाः ! ●देश +यत्. A grammatical
inaccuracy, for the Tad. affix, though added to in this sense,
is not available in the case of compounds ending in . Vanâyu
is a country in the North-West of India, celebrated for its breed
of horses. The reason of making the horses lick pieces
of Rock-salt is given in the Sanj. - : (produced in"
