"Canto VI. ]
(171)
of the Ruler of all movable and immovable things, destroyed, .
in the battle that ensued, all the enemies of the gods. He thus
acquired the name of Kakutstha or he who sits upon the hump.
See Wilson's Vish. P. and the quotation from the Bhág. P.
given in the ft. note. Vide also s'lokas 72-73.
:-Malli. translates this by gg: and quotes Amara
in support of his meaning. But we find ¾¶ in all the printed
texts of Amara, and not, and it is difficult to see which is
the misprint. 3 as explained by the commentators of Amara
means 'one whose name is oft repeated, is in every one's mouth; .
आहतलक्षणः -- आहतमभ्यस्तं लक्षणं नाम यस्य । लक्ष्यतेऽनेनेति लक्षणं नाम; while
आहितलक्षण means आहितं कृतं लक्षणं ( & characteristic mark ) येन who
made for him the distinguishing mark, &c. The meaning '4-
:' is better got out from the former, and , therefore, seems
to be a misprint in the Sanj. :-having always a noble ambi-
tion, high-souled. at any: a proud, glorious.
SI. 72. TT &c.-See Sanj. and note on
III. 32.
प्राप्तपिनाकिलीलः – पिनाक: (पातीति that which protects ) the bow of -
Siva. fis S'iva, the wielder of the bow; the graceful.
appearance or action; who attained the graceful appearance of S'iva
गण्डस्थलीः- प्रशस्ता गण्डा गण्डस्थलानि; fem. गण्डस्थल्य: । A Nitya-sam&sa.
if-see ft.-note; q: ornamental figures in the shape of
leaves &c. painted on their cheeks and breasts by women.'
S1. 73. ऐरावत &c. - इरा water, इराः सन्त्यस्मिन् इति इरावान् the sea;
इरावति भव ऐरावतः the celestial elephant churned out of the ocean.
-stroking, thumping on the back; cf. FaarensasõÑA
Kum. III. 22. i-slipped down. This explains how the two
armlets rubbed against each other, when Indra was sitting in his
own august form. The neu. 37 meaning exactly a half
comes first in a Gen. Tat.; see Sanj.; but : will mean a part
of the seat. उपेयुषः - See ft. -note. गोत्रभिदः - गां the earth त्रायन्त इति
: the mountains; fyî; see note on ¶ &c. III. 60..
Mr. Pandit has the following note on this:-More literally gotra is a
place where cows are kept, a cow-pen; hence, a place where the cows of
heaven were concealed, i. e., a cave of the mountain or cloud.
Indra is everywhere praised in the hymns of the Veda for his
having broken asunder the mountains (i. e. the clouds) by his
thunderbolt (i. e. lightning) and liberated the heavenly cows (the.
rain-waters)'. -mark the change of to. The substitu-
tion of takes place in the case of ur even though the reduplicative
syllable intervens. Pân. VIII. 3. 64.
