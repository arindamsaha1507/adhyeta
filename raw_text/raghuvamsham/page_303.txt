45. They inquired of the aged cowherds, that came to them
with fresh butter, the names of the wild trees by the road-side.
46. As they journeyed on, clad in bright apparel, an indescriba-
ble beauty was visible in them, like that in the conjunction of the

winter.
47. Engaged in showing this thing and that thing (i. e. the
various curiosities of the road) to his spouse, the lord of the earth,
of amiable appearance and worthy to be compared with Budha,
was not even aware of the whole distance travelled over.
48. He (the king,) of a fame unattainable (by any one eise)

a share of the nîva'ra corn (wild rice) and blocking up the doors
of the huts, as if they were the children of the wives of the
hermits;
51.-wherein the saplings were quitted by the hermits' daughters
immediately after the watering was over, in order to inspire confi-
dence in the birds accustomed to drink water from the basins
round the roots of the trees;
52.-where the antelopes were chewing the cud, squatting in
the courtyards of the huts in which wild rice had been collected
into heaps, at the decline of the evening sunshine.
53. which was purifying the casual visitors coming towards it
by the columns of smoke, indicating the blazing of fires, shaken
up by the wind and charged with the odour of the offerings.
54. Then having ordered the charioteer to give rest to the
horses, the king assisted his wife to alight from the car and him-
self also got down.
55.
The hospitable saints, with their senses perfectly controlled,
gave an honourable welcome to him, their worthy protector,"
