This, in brief, is the ancient Hindu ideal of Kingship; and it is
here illustrated by a series of brilliant portraits which aim at show-
ing the culture and civilization of ancient India at their best. It is
true that a poet's powers of depicting a character are best seen in
a play, which is a , while in a long poem dealing with a
series of kings characters will occupy-comparatively-a secondary
place, it being the poet's object to make each canto an attractive
piece of poetry by exhibiting his powers of narration and descrip-
tion in melodious and poetical language. Nevertheless, there
will be sufficient scope for character-painting if the poet takes care
to choose just suitable episodes for detailed narration, relegating
minor incidents to the back-ground, or even omitting them altogether.
Kaličasa has done this, and he has skilfully selected those
incidents in the careers of his heroes which possess an absorbing
dramatic interest; thus the reader, when he comes to Dilipa's
contest with the lion, or to Raghu's with Indra, feels the whole
scene being acted before his eyes as though on a real stage. It is
such scenes that leave a permanent impression on the reader, withont
being simply bald statements of facts in metrical language.
The poet begins with King Dilipa. His general virtues are
described in ślokas 13-29 of canto I.; it is a description which,
it may be remarked in passing, applies in a greater or less degree
to all good and noble kings. We can hardly understand him that
way; if we are to know him better, we must have something
more definite than a conventional description. Dilipa had no
issue and he decides to consult Vasishtha on that account, which
shows his great reverence for his spiritual guru and his faith in
the efficacy of religious rites in attaining the desired end.
Vasishtha enjoins upon him service of the holy cow in his
possession; the readiness with which the King accepts the task,
and the rigorous exactitude with which ho performs it, show how
simple and duty-loving his nature was.
With him kingly grace
was not incompatible with simplicity. But the trait of character
which raises him far above the level of ordinary kings is his
interview with the lion wherein he offers his own body in exchange
for that of the cow, recalling the famous instance of Sibi saving
the pigeon in a similar manner. The moral may be given in the
24 If this were not so, where was the necessity of describing in
etail a model Government under the obscure King Atithi (Canto XVII.),
wben it could, with better propriety, have been done under Raghu ?"
