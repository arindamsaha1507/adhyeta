57. Verily the libation of water, offered by me, is drunk, rendered
lukewarm with their sighs, by my forefathers, thinking that it
would be difficult to be obtained after my death.
68. I, therefore, with my soul purified by the performance
of sacrifices, but obscured by want of issue, am both shining and
not shining like the mountain Loka'loka (which is lighted on one
side and dark on the other).
69. Religious merit, resulting from the performance of penance
and acts of charity, produces happiness in the next world; but off-
spring, of pure extraction, leads to bliss in the next, as also in
this world.
70. How is it, O mighty sage, that you are not grieved to see.
me destitute of the same, like a sapling of the hermitage, watered
personally through affection, bearing no fruit?
71. Know then, O mighty one, that the last debt has been
causing me unendurable pain, as the tie-post piercing the vitals,
does to an elephant, deprived of the bath.
72. It behoves you, O father, to do that by which I may be
released from it; for when an object is difficult of attainment to the
descendants of Ikshváku, the success depends upon you."
73. Thus respectfully informed by the king, the saint remained
for a moment, with his eyes fixed in meditation, like a tank, with
its fish asleep.
74. He whose soul was purified by ascetic exercises, discover-
ed by meditation the cause of the stoppoge of issue to the lord
of the earth and then informed him thus:-
75. "On a former occasion, when you were returning to the
earth, having waited upon Indra, Surabhi (the divine cow) was
reposing under the shade of a Kalpa-(desire-granting) tree on
your way.
76. Full of thoughts of this your queen, bathed after menstrua-
tion, being afraid to violate a sacred obligation (to her), you did
not act properly towards her who deserved the honour (lit. act) of
circumambulation.
77. (And) she cursed you thus :-'Since you have shown
disrespect to me, no progeny shall be born to you unless you
propitiate my daughter.'
78. Neither by you, nor by your charioteer, was the impreca-
tion heard (being pronounced), as the stream of the Celestia!"
