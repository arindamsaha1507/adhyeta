supreme lord Vishnu, and makes peace with him. The party then
safely arrive in Ayodhyâ.
CANTO XII. King Dasaratha, who had grown old and was near-
ing his end, declares his intention to set Râma on the throne, when
Kaikeyi oontrives, by means of two boons which her husband
had promised her, to have Ráma exiled for fourteen years and
to have her son Bharata installed King. Râms quite willingly
undertakes to go to the forest, and the old King, grieving at
being separated from his beloved son, dies heart-broken, thus
fulfilling the old man's curse (Canto IX ). Bharata declines to
accept the sovereignty earned by intrigue, and after vainly
trying to persuade Râma to come back, himself remains a sort
of exile at Nandigráma, and from that place he rules the kingdom as
Ráma's representative. In his journey to the forest Râma is
accompanied by Sítá and Lakshmaṇa. He there kills Virādha,
Dúshaṇa, Khara, and other demons, the news of whose death is
carried to Ravana in Lanka by his sister Súrpanakhā,
whom Lakshmaṇa had disfigured. Ravana comes and carries off
Sith in Râma’s abgence. Râma makes friends with Sugriva,
the monkey-Chief, and through his retainer Maruti discovers
the whereabouts of Sîtá. Building a bridge over the sea, Râma
with Sugrîva's army crosses into Lankâ, and is engaged in a
series of battles with the hosts of Rāvana, whose death he
finally accomplishes. Ráma recovers Sîtá, gives Ravaṇa's
kingdom to his brother Vibhîshana, and starts back for Ayodhyā
in the well-known aerial car, Pushpaka, along with Sugrîva and
Vibhîshaṇa and their armies.
CANTO XIII. The journey of Râma from Laňkâ to Ayodhya
by air is here described. Râma points out to Sîtâ the various
objects and places of interest on the way, including, in order,
Janasthána, the mountain Malyavat, the lake Pampâ, the
Godavari, Panchavatî, the dwelling-places of the sages Agastya,
Satakarni and Sarabhanga, the mountain Chitrakata, the stream
Mandâkinî, the rivers Gangâ and Yamunâ, and lastly the Sarayú,
After they had seen the Sarayú they observe Bharata advancing
with an army to welcome the home-coming king. Râma gets down
from the Pushpaka, and the meeting of the brothers is touchingly
described. Then Râma again gets into the car and arrives at
last in a garden outside Ayodhyâ, his capital.
CANTO XIV. There in the garden Râma and Lakshmana see
their mothers who greet them with joy. Râma is then"
