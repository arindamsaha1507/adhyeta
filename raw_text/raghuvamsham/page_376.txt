[ Canto IX
curved claws, the descendant of Kakutstha thought himself to
have, as it were, discharged, by means of his arrows, the debt he
owed to the elephants that had done him a service on the
battle-field.
66. In some places urging his horse in pursuit of the 'Chamara'
deer and sending forth a shower of crescent-shaped arrows ()
drawn to the ear, he felt immediately at ease after having deprived
them, like kings, of their white chowries (i. e. their bushy tails).
67. He did not aim his arrow at (lit. make him the mark of
his arrow) the peacock having a beautiful plumage although
skipping about near his horse, being instantly put in mind of the
luxuriant tresses of his beloved interwoven with variegated flowers
and with their band loosened in amatory sports.
68. The sylvan breeze, which was saturated with cold dew-
drops and which had opened the folds of the tender leaves, drank
(dried) up the sweat caused by his hard exercise and collected
into clusters of drops on his face,
69. Thus did Hunting, like a clever damsel, attract away
that Lord of the Earth, who, forgetful of his other kingly duties,
had entrusted to his ministers the responsible task of governing
the kingdom, and whose love (passion) for it was increased by
its continuous practice..
70. The king, unattended by any followers, passed, in some
place, one night, in which tender flowers and leaves served as his
bedding, and which was furnished with lights (in the form)
of blazing powerful herbs.
71. There the king, whose slumber was dispelled at day-break
by the musical flappings of the ears of the elephand-herd,
resembling the sound of deep-sounding drums, amused himself
by listening to the sweet auspicious songs of bards in the form of
the warblings of birds.
72. Then on one occasion the king, who had taken (i. e. was
following) the path of a deer, unnoticed in the forest by his attend-
ants, came with his horse foaming through exhaustion to the
river Tamasâ much frequented by ascetics.
73. From its waters arose (or was heard) a clear, loud sound
produced by the filling up of a jar; mistaking it for the grunt of
an elephant, he discharged in that direction an arrow tracking
(its mark) by the sound.
74. What Das'aratha did, trausgressing the bounds of law,
was surely forbidden to a king. Indeed, even men conversant"
