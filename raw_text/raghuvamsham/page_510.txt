Gen. or a Loc. Tat. A bird often referred to in Sanskrit
poetry as entirely deponding on clouds for water to drink. cf. -
vai : Rit. II. 3.
The Chataka is not a fabulous bird, and what Kali. says here is a fact.
It is a migratory bird which is seen in India in the rainy season and
disappears in the autumn. It has a shrill but not unpleasant note, which
is of the same pitch as that of the cuckoo, and very much resembles the
word for 'a cloud' pronounced as vocative. Hence the bird is supposed
to invoke the clouds for a shower, that it may intercept a few drops to
quench its thirst. S. P. Pandit in his notes to Vik. II. thus describes
the bird that is seen in Western India-'It is a small bird, smaller than
the sinallest dove, has a long tail and combines in itself the black, the
yellow and the white. It has a long crest on its head, of the shape of a
bow with an arrow stretched on it, which is supposed to prevent it from
bending its head by coming opposite the back and thereby to prevent it
from drinking water lying on the ground-or any water to drink which
the beak is to be lowered.'
TFT-For the force of this see Sanj. and ft.-note. The fig. of
speech here is far according to Dandin, Bhoja &o., and
according to modern writors on Rhetoric.
81. 18. एतावत् एतत् परिमाणमस्य । प्रतियानुकामम् - The nasal of
the inf. is dropped before
and ay; see Sanj. "fis properly
a substantive from far with the affix g. What is used in
classical Sanskrit as the infinitive mood is only the acc. sing. of a
mas, substantive ending in g. In the Veda we meet with the Abl.
Gen. and Dat. sing. of the so-called infinitive; e. g. naà, ì: &c:"
Pandit. Cf. 'रे हस्त दक्षिण मृतस्य शिशोर्द्विजस्य जीवातवे विसृज शूद्रभुनी कृपाणम् ।'
Uttar. II. 10. -By the rule ai st' the agent takes
Gen. or Inst. in connexion with a
so both

are admissible.
S'1. 19. यथावत् – यथा यादृशमईतीति यथावत् । यथावत् विहितः यथावद्विहितः
a. The Dat. here is siguificant. It shows that Kautsa
gives the details to Ragha, because he wished to know them. It is"
