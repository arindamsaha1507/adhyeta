The Râmâyana thus accounts for the name:-When all the sons of
Diti were killed in a fierce battle by Aditi's sons, the former implor-
ed her husband, Kas'yapa, to bless her with a son that could kill
Indra in a fight. To this Kashyapa consented and ordered her to
observe strict purity for two thousand years. While arg was thus
in the womb, Indra, the step-son of Diti, got jealous of the superior
prowess of the forthcoming child, and watching his opportunity,.
entered the womb when his mother was asleep (with her head
towards the wrong end of the bed and thus in an impure state) and
began dissecting the foetus. The child cried with pain, when Indra,
fearing lest its cries should rouse his mother, whispered out ' BE'
'do not cry'. Diti was roused and requested Indra to spare the
child that was already hewn into seven pieces.
46. The child was saved and was called

therefore gladdening. Ter &c.-This epithet is used to show
that the breeze was gentle and fragrant. अनोकह - अनसः शकटस्याकं

a carriage, hence a tree. The direct mention of is not very
poetical. Seo note on I. 38.

two epithets show how much the king was in need of some refreshing
agencies, while the third part supplies the reason why he was
served even by the wind (the purifying element; mark the signifi-
cance of q). See Sanj. -Pure by his conduct, which
was in strict accordance with scriptural rules and established custom.
