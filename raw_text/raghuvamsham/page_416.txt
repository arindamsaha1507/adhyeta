§ 827. दीर्घसत्रस्य - सीदन्त्यत्र इति सत्रम् that in which priests sit down,
a sacrificial session. The period of time required for a Satra varies
between one year and a thousand years. See Bhâg-P. I. 1. 4. The
distinction between an ordinary sacrifice and a dîrgha satra is this;
in the former the merit arising from the sacrifice belongs wholly to
the Yajamâna, the priests getting only the dakshina, while in the-
latter the merit is shared by the Yajamána and the sixteen priests.
