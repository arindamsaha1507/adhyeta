[Canto X.
S'1. 13.
¶¶¶¶¶-Vinatá, the mother of Garudr, had
come to be the slave of Kadra, his step mother, Garada, wishing
to purchase the freedom of his mother, undertook to bring down
from heaven Amṛta, as desired by Kadru. While he was returning
with the nectar after a hard fight with the gods he was struck by
Indra with his Vajra which left a scar on his body.

Adh. XXXIII, 18, 19. f &c.-Malli. alludes to the following
story-"Mátali, the charioteer of Indra, had a daughter named
Gunakes'î (g) who was counted first among beautiful women.
Failing, on inquiry, to find among gods and among men a husband
suitable for his daughter, Mâtali went to the world of the Nagas
(ar), and considering a beautiful Nâga named Sumukha
() to be a fit person for the hand of his daughter, he resolved
to bestow her on him. Garuda (), who had devoured
Sumukha's father, had also resolved to devour Sumukha within one
month. Having heard all this, Mâtali carried his would-be son-in-
law to Indra, the king of the gods, with the view of rescuing him
from Garuda's clutches. Fearing lest he might incur the anger of
Garuda by doing anything himself, Indra, with the permission of
Vishnu, conferred on Sumukha long life and immunity from danger.
Having heard this, Garuda began in anger to rebuke Indra and
Vishnu, and repeatedly vaunted his own strength and might. With
the view of crushing Garuda's pride, Vishnu said: "If you can bear
the weight of this my arm, your self-glorification is just." Saying
this, he placed his arm on Garuda's neck. Under the weight of
that arm of Vishnu, Garuda felt sorely oppressed, became restless
and at last insensible. From that time Garuda humbled and crest-
fallen, began to reside near Vishnu in a submissive spirit." Tárá-
kumára. See. Mah. Bhâr. Mátaliyopakhyana.
S'l. 14. aa-The sleep of meditation of Vishnu which is
different from ordinary sleep to which mortal are subject and in
which all consciousness is suspended and which is therefore a form of
death. It is a sleep such as a Yogin sleeps, in which conciousness &s
well as memory is present, and in which the sleeper enjoys commu-
nion with absent things and persons belonging to different ages-ir.
which, in fact, the ordinary conditions and limits of knowledges are
outstripped.
-Bhrgu-one of the Prajapatis and foremont
among the primaval sages, called Brahmarshis, the mind-born sons cf
Brahmá. The Vish. P. mentions them as nine, viz Bhrga, Palastys,"
