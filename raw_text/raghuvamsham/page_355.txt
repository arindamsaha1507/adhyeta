"Canto VII.]
(57)
40. The fish-shaped flags with their mouths opened by the
force of the wind, and taking in the thickened dust of the army,
looked like real fishes drinking the new muddy rain-waler.
41. The cloud of dust growing dense, the chariot was known
by the rattling of the wheels, and the elephant by the tinkling of
his moving bells; while the distinction of friend or foe was made
by the declaration of the master's name.
42. As on the battle-field there spread the darkness in the
form of dust obstructing the sight, the stream of blood, gushing
forth from the bodies of horses, elephants and warriors, (who were)
wounded with the weapons of war, arose like the morning sun
dispelling the darkness.
43. The column of dust, having its base cut off by the blood,
and tossed about by the wind above it, looked like the previously
arisen smoke of a fire now reduced to (a few) burning embers.
44. At the end of the swoon caused by a blow, the chariot-
warriors protected in the chariots (being removed from the battle-
field) took their charioteers severely to task, and making them
turn back the horses (towards the field of battle), furiously attack-
ed those very (antagonists) by whom they had been wounded and
whose flags they had previously marked.
45. The arrows discharged by dexterous archers, though cut
down in the course of their flight by the arrows of their adver-
saries, reached the mark aimed at with their first halves tipped
with iron, by reason of the continuation of their original velocity.
46. In the elephant fight, the heads of the drivers though
severed by quoits having razor-like edges, fell down after a long
time, the hair on them being entangled in the pointed extremities
of the talons of the hawks (hovering above).
47. The horseman who was the first to strike did not again
strike at his adversary unable to return the blow, but waited, un-
til the latter, with his body reclining on the neck of his horse,
came back to his senses.
48. The terrified elephants quenched with the spray from their
trunks the fire that was struck out, as the unsheathed swords of
the armoured warriors fighting desperately fell on their huge
tusks.
49. The battle-field looked like the very wassail-ground of
Death, rich in fruits in the form of the heads of warriors severed"
