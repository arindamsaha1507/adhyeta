[Canto VI.
the actual or emblematic sacrifice of a horse.
This sacrifice was one of the highest order, and, performed a hundred times,
entitled the sacrificer to the dominion of Svarga or Paradise. It appears
to bave been originally typical; the horse and other animals being simply
bound during the performance of certain ceremonies. In the As'vamedha
of the Vedic period, six hundred and nine animals of various prescribed
kinds, domestic and wild, including birds, fish, and reptiles, were made
fast, the tame ones to twenty-one posts, and the wild, in the intervals
between the pillars; and, after certain prayers were recited, the victims
were let loose without injury. The horse, which is the subject of As'ca-
medha, was also avowedly an emblem of Viraj, or the primeval and uni-
versal manifested Being. In the last section of the Taittiriya-Yajurveda,
the various parts of the horse's body are described as divisions of time and
portions of the universe; morning is his head; the sun, his eye; air, his
breath; the moon, his ear; &c. A similar passage in the 14th book of the
S'atapatha-Brahmana describes the same allegorical horse, for the medi-
tation of such as cannot perform an As'vamedha; and the assemblage of
living animals, constituting an imaginary victim, at a real As'vamedha,
equally represents the universal being, according to the doctrines of the
Vedas. The actual sacrifices of horses and men in the As'vamedha and
Purushamedha, were not authorized by the Vedas: but were either then
abrogated, and an emblematical ceremony substituted in their place; or they
must have been introduced in later times, on the authority of certain Purá-
as or Tantras, fabricated by persons who, in this as in other inatters,
established inany unjustifiable practices, on, the foundation of emblems
and allegories which they misunderstood. the Post-Vedic period, none
but an emperor (universal monarch), was authorized to perform As'ta-
medha. It is thus said by A'pastamba, "újšískāùa ūžā
" &c. (See Colebrooke on the Vedas).

means 'to conquer back.' Cf. gata Mah. Bhár.
