-Lauhity is the ancient name for the Brah-
maputra. Raghu orossed the river and re-entered India by the North-
castern frontier where lay the kingdom of Prágjyotisha. The an-
cient capital of Kámarúpa was at Prågjyotishapura situated on the
Lauhitya. grsifa:-The lord of Pragjyotisha or the City of

Bhootan and Eastern Ass30m. कालागुरुमैः - - कालान्यगुरूण्येव हुमा
कालागुरुद्रमाः | As Raghu's elephants were tied to the trees they
quaked and simultaneously with them tremblod also the king of
the land with fear. For a similar idea cf. sl. 69.

hábharata. In the Sabháparva he is said to have fought with Arjuna.
for eight days with an army of 'Kirátas, Ohinas, and seafaring men.'
And in the Udyogaparva he is said to have assisted Duryodhana
with an army of the Kirátas and Ohînas, From these references it
is clear that his kingdom must have extended upto the Himalaya on
the north and the borders of China on the cast. Further, Kâlidása
speaks hore of elephants which are still found in the jungles of Upper
Assam and the Dooars, and of the aloe-wood tree which,.
according to Dr. Roxburgh, is a native of the eastern frontier; and
this fact also leads to the same inference. Tag'ca &c.—H

to that of Indrs is very pertinent. It shows how Raghu's very
name struck terror into the heart of the king. of Kimarúpa
