EXTRACT FROM
PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
In presenting to the public this new edition of the Raghuvams'a, the
editor feels himself called upon to explain the reasons for thus adding to
the already large number of the existing editions of this poem. Certain
Cantos of the Raghuvamsa are generally prescribed for the higher examina-
tions of Indian Universities, and the students feel the want of some good
and correct edition which would be a useful and a safe guide in acquiring
the varied information required of them by the University examiners
Only four or five editions, published here and at Calcutta, contain English
notes and translation, and are thus meant to meet the wants of High
School and College students. But in the humble opinion of the present
editor they have certain deficiencies of their own, and are therefore
inadequate for the purpose for which they are intended. The commentary
of Mallinâtha, though excellent in itself and a good guide to advanced
scholars, is practically of small use to ordinary students. Judged from
the standpoint of a beginner, it has certain distinct disadvantages.
Its terseness of style and the technicalities of grammar it introduces,
puzzle the novice; again it does not often give the full vigraha of
compounds but merely explains them. It does not also give the derivation
of words. For these and other things the student has to depend upon
English explanatory notes. No attempt has yet been made to give com-
plete and exhaustive notes, critical, grammatical as well as explanatory...
...... The present edition is an humble attempt to remedy all these defects.
Since Mallinâtha explains each S'loka by giving its anvaya, as he himself
tells us in the introductory S'lokas to his commentary, the construction is
not given separately. But the words of the text are printed in bold type
in the com. in their prose order, and where Mallinátha does not quote the
actual words of the text they are given enclosed in rectangular brackets
After reading the S'loka the student should read the words in bold type in
the commentary in order, and he will get the construction or anvaya. This
will also assist him in separating the words of the text and readily finding
out their meaning given by Mallinâtha, as it immediately follows them.
Difficult words in the Samjivanî are explained in easy Sanskrit in the
foot-notes, which also supply the deficiencies of Mallinátha's commentary
where necessary by giving extracts from other commentaries and similar
extraneous sources-an arrangement which will greatly add to the
usefulness of the book without creating any confusion....
A full, literal translation has also been given. What is intended is
this: The student should first read the S'loka, then the anvaya and then
the meaning in Sanskrit; he should then translate it in his own words and"
