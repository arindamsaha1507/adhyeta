however, the reading be-ra the first sense alone is possible.
For either or is correct when the meaning is 'polleu' or
filaments of flowers; but when the meaning is 'the mane of a lion'
(or horse) alone is the correct form. Thi sl. shows that the
horses were quite refreshed and were now ready for fight again.
The horses are especially mentioned here because Raghu had to
make use of his cavalry in fighting with the Persians who were also
and the horses were hard-taxed.

:-In the Sab. P. of the Mah. Bhár. (XXVII.
22-3) the Kambojas are said to have been conquered by Arjuna along
with the Daradas, after the conquest of Balkh. They must have
inhabited the Hindukusha mountain which separates the Giljit valloy
from Balkh and the adjoining country, as its Kâfirs, according to
Elphinstone, still call themselves Kamoj, and probably extended upto
Little Thibet and Ladak. Their country was famous for handsome
horses and shawls made of goats', rats', and dogs' wool, and abounded
in walnut trees. In the great war of Kurukshetra they are said to
have fought on the side of the Kauravas. According to the Puranas
they were originally Kshatriyas but degraded by the omission of
the necessary rites. आनताः - (1) the trees bent down being
pulled down by the elephants; (2) the kings bowed in submission
to Raghu.
