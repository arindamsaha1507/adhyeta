Moon. Now because Soma, the plant', was developed into a personifica -
tion by certain attributes, therefore, Soma, the Moon, acquired also the
same attributes.' And thus it is that the Moon, also came to be described
as 'the King or Lord of the plants.
S'l. 74. grr:-Purandara or the destroyer of the enemies'
cities,' is a name of Indra, because he is described in the hymns of
the Rigveda as having destroyed the cities of his enemies, i. e. the
clouds. In the Purâņas, however, he is described as often being driven
out of his heaven by the demons, but as always re-entering his capital
on all such occasions, after having finally overcome his foes, and
restoring order to the universe. Here the poet probably refers to this
when he says that Dilipa, entering his capital and once more resuming
the government of the earth, had the grace of Indra.

The lord of serpents is S'esha regarded as the emblem of eternity,
whence he is also called Ananta. He is represented as supporting the
entire world on his head. Cf. Vish. Purána 'qatatalagerà fargiai

&c.-Atri is a celebrated sage and author
of many Vedic hymns. He is one of the sons of Brahmá. According
to the Váyu P., the essence of Soma or moon dropped down in ten
streams from the eyes of Atri, while he was absorbed in meditation.
The presiding goddesses of the ten quarters, at the command of
Brahma, bore the foetus and the moon was born. For a fuller account,
