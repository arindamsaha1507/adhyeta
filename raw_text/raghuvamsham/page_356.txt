ing cups, and with a stream of blood for wine.
50. A female jackal snatched from the birds a severed arm,
from the extremities of which flesh was pecked up by them; but
though fond of flesh, she flung it away, the roof of her palate
being wounded by the armlet worn on it.
51. A certain warrior having his head severed off by his ad.
versary's sword instantly became the master of a celestial car.
and with a heavenly nymph clung to his left side beheld his own
headless trunk dancing about on the battle-field.
52. Two other chariot-warriors, by their each killing the cha-

final destruction of the universe.
57. When engaged in battle he was seen putting the right nor
the left hand into (or, after Malli,-beautifully moving his right
hand about) the mouth of the quiver; it seemed as if the bow.
