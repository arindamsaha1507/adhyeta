circumstances, and had not the misfortune ever to drink the bitter
cup of poverty. He was a Brahmana by caste and was a devout
worshipper of Siva, though by no means a sectarian. He seems to
have travelled a good deal, at least in Northern India, For, as Dr.
Bhau Dâjî remarks, he is the only poet who describes a living saffron
flower, the plant of which grows in Kashmir. His graphic descrip-
tion of the Himalayan scenes looks very much like that of one who
was an eye-witness. Unlike Bhavabhûti and many other brother-
poets, he appears to have enjoyed great popularity during his life-
time. He was an admirer of field-sports,' and 'describes their
beneficial effects with the exactness of a true sportsman.' Though
fond of pleasures he was not the unscrupulous voluptuary he is
supposed to be by some critics, as is clear from the many noble
sentiments expressed in the Sakuntala. It also appears from the
same play that he was against love-marriages, though always
actuated with the most generous sentiments towards the fair sex.
His works bear further testimony to his considerable acquaintance
with the Vedas, the philosophy taught by the Upanishads, the Epics
and the Puránas, the Bhagavadgitá, the systems of Sámkhya,
Yoga, and Vedánta as propounded by Bâdarâyana, Medicine,
and the rudiments of Astronomy. Beyond these few facts nothing
is known for certain about our poet at present. It is inevitable
that, during the course of time, a number of fanciful stories and.
legends should have clustered round the popular hero of literary
India. Thus there is a story which relates how the poet was born
a blockhead and a dunce, but had wisdom bestowed upon him in
consequence of his subsequent propitiation of the goddess Kâlî,
whence his name Kálidása. Another story makes him a friend of
King Kumáradása of Ceylon, in whose city Kálidása was murdered
by a courtesan. No reliance need be placed on such accounts.
Many such stories will be found in the Sanskrit Bhojaprabandha, and
in a collection which, under the title of Tales of King Bhoja
and Poet Kálidása, is a popular book in many Indian vernaculars.
A few conjectures have been advanced as to some other particulars,
but to test their veracity falls strictly within the province
of the antiquary.
The poet's silence about himself in his works gave an
His Works opportunity to many unscrupulous inferior poets to
father their own works upon him. The following is
