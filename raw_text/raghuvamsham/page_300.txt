between good and bad) to listen to this (poem); for it is in fire
alone that the purity or alloy of gold is tested.
11. There was a king, by name Manu, the son of Vivasvat,
esteemed by the wise, who was the first of kings, as the sacred
syllble Om is of the Vedas.
12. In this pure race was born a purer king, Dilipa by name,
a supremely eminent monarch, just as the purer moon arose from
the pure milky ocean.
13. Broad-chested, stout-shouldered (lit. having shoulders
like those of a bull), tall as the s'a'la tree, and massive-armed, he
looked like the military virtue (heroism) appearing in a corporeal
frame fitted for the discharge of its duties.
14. Like the mountain Meru, he stood occupying (dominating)
the whole earth, with a frame that exceeded all in strength,
outshone all in lustre and transcended all in majesty.
15. His intellect was commensurate with his bodily form,
his knowledge with his intelligence, his undertakings with
his knowledge, and his success with his undertakings.
16. By his kingly virtues which were both awe-inspiring and
amiable he was to his subjects, at once unapproachable and invit-
ing, just as the ocean is on account of its monsters and gems.
17. Acting like the rim of a wheel under a skilful driver, the
subjects of him, their guide, swerved not even to the width of a
line from the path that had been trodden from the days of Manu
18. He received taxes from his subjects only for the promotion
of their welfare: for the sun sucks up water simply to give it back
a thousand-fold (in the shape of rain).
19. His army was but an appendage to him; his means of
accomplishing his objects were only twofold-an intelligence that
was unfoiled in (penetrated) the branches of learning, and the
string stretched out on the bow.
20. His counsels being secret and his countenance and designs
inscrutable, his measures, like the impressions (left on the mind
by the good or evil deeds) of a prior existence, were to be inferred
only from their results.
21. (Though) without fear, he protected his body; unafflicted
with disease he performed religious rites; unavaricious he
amassed wealth; and unaddicted he enjoyed pleasures."
