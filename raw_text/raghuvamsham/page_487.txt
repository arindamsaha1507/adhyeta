this mountain with Mahendra Mâle which divides Ganjam from
the valley of Mahánadî. According to Anndoram Borooah, how-
ever, it included the whole of the eastern Ghats between the Mahâ-
nadî and the Godavarî. Kâlidása calls the king of Kalinga 'lord of
Mahendra,' and Kalinga was not limited to the country about Ganjam
but extended upto the Godávarî. The present town of Rájamahen-
drî on the Godavarî probably originally represented the capital
of the Lord of Mahendra. -(a) unbearable ( garg ); ( 6 ).

also refer to Raghu 'the controller' i. e. chastiser of the haughty.
गम्भीरवेदिनः— गम्भीरे वेदितुं शीलमस्य This is a technical name for a
king of elephauts. According to a Śl. quoted by Châr. from the
Pâlakápya (see-ft, note), and another quoted by Malli. from the
Râjaputriya, a Gambhiravedî elephant is one who is not easily
sensible to wounds, cutting of flesh or actual spilling of blood from
his body. According to another quotation given by Malli., an
elephant who is slow in understanding even well-understood signs
is called गम्भीरवेदी.
S1. 40 प्रतिजग्राह - प्रतिग्रहू nsually means 'to accept;' here it
means 'to oppose, to meet or receive in a hostile spirit.' The root
occurs again in this sense in VII. 36. :-the king of the
Kalingas. As this signifies one individual, the 370 is retained.
For allusion see supra III. 60. This epithet also
applies to Raghu. q means the allies, 'the forces on the side of the
enemy;' aftfaat Ję: &c. For the recurrence of the same
thought, cf. 'शमितपक्षबल: शतकोटिना' &c. IX 12. शिलावर्षी - शिला: rocks,
hillocks. Kalinga was like a mountain of yore. For he fought
with huge elephants who resembled in colour, size and strength,
the hillocks thrown by the mountains upon Indra. Cf. VI. 54.
Ś1. 41. काकुत्स्थः - ककुत्स्थस्य गोत्रापत्यं पुमान्काकुत्स्थः । The descendant
of Kakutstha. For the allusion, see VI. 71-73 and note under 71;
also the quotation from Bhág. P. given in the ft.-note, p. 146; also
Hariv. Chap. X. नाराचदुर्दिनम् - नराणां समूहो नारम् । नारमाचामतीतिः
an arrow made wholly of iron or steel (and therefore surely
killing by entering deep into the body ). दुर्दिनम् – means by लक्षणा
a shower. This answers the purpose of a bath. सन्मङ्गलस्नातः-
मङ्गलाय स्नातः म०; or मङ्गलेन मङ्गलद्रव्यमिश्रेण जलेन सर्वौषधिजलेन वा (see Sanj.)
स्नातः मङ्गलस्नातः । सत् यथाविधि मङ्गलस्नातः सन्मङ्गलस्नातः । It is necessary
according to the Sástras to take an auspicious bath before taking
possession of . The poet fancies that this was furnished in the"
