To witness the scene of destruction there came the goddess Durgâ, bearing
in her arms a child of wondrous effulgence. Indra, getting jealous of the
child, raised his thunderbolt for its destruction, when strangely enough,
the arm of Indra became motionless, being paralysed by the glance of
the child. In this plight Indra saw Brahmâ, who told him to propitiate
the child, which was no other than S'iva himself, who had assumed that
form to please Durgâ. Thereupon Indra, accompanied by all the gods,
went to the child and propitiated it with prayers and had his arm released >
from the paralysis.
