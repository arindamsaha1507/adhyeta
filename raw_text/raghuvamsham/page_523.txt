The woman is
a dearly loved by her hushand, and though,
unable to read his thoughts, (i. e. to know whether he is really
longing for her ), yet makes a tardy approach towards him of her
own accord (ſaſa ), which an offended lady does not do..
See below, śl. 67. The simple idea so poetically expressed by the
poet is, that Aja being absorbed in thoughts about Indumati could
not get sleep for a long time. The report of Indumatî's unparal-
lelled charms had attracted such a crowd of kings there, that, pitted
against these, Aja could well feel misgivings within himself. It is.

and he had to put down his pen. The goddess of learning, however,
wishing to gratify the wish of her favourite son, wrote down for

remarks:-"These 'awakening verses' have no special reference to
the present time and place, but form what the bards used to recite
in the Prince's own capital." But the remark does not seem to be
correct. The poet's description of the bards as
scarcely
leaves us room to suppose that they sang on this occasion the same
stale and hackneyed song which they were wout to sing in the capital.
On the contrary, the contents of the verses show that they are meant
peculiarly to suit the present occasion. For the bards begin with
early morn, first describing how the moon gradually loses her
splendour and how the lotuses are about to bloom and then how"
