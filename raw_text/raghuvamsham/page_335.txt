(37)
sanctuary of (holy) fires, for two or three days, in which time
I will endeavour to fulfil your object.
26. With the words 'Be it so' the Brahmapa, being delighted,
accepted his unfailing promise. Raghu, on his part, seeing that
the earth was drained of all its wealth, wished to wrench (thought
of procuring by force) money from Kubera.
27. By virtue of the miraculous power accruing from Vasish-
tha's sprinkling accompanied by holy incantations (at the time
of his coronation), the course of his chariot, like that of a cloud
assisted by the wind, was not obstructed, whether on the sea, or
in the sky, or on the mountains.
28. Then in the evening Raghu, firm-minded and pious, slept
in his chariot in the interior of which weapons were arranged,
desirous of conquering the lord of Kailása (Kubera) by his prowess,
looking upon him as (as if he were no better than ) a mere
feudatory prince.
29. At dawn, officers, employed in the treasury, full of wonder,
reported to him, about to setfourth, a shower of gold fallen from
the sky into the treasury-house.
30. The king gave to Kautsa the whole of that glittering
heap of gold which was obtained from Kubera, who was about to
be attacked, and which looked like an adjoining hill of the
(mountain) Sumeru detached by Indra's thunder-bolt.
31. Both of them, the suitor who would not take (lit. who
had no desire to accept) more than what was to be given to his
preceptor, and the king who gave more than what was asked
by the suitor, had the greatness of their mind (or their conduct)
greatly praised by the people inhabiting Sâketa (Ayodhyà).
32. Then at his departure, the great sage Kautsa, delighted in
the mind, touched by the hand the king who had caused his
treasure to be transported (or conveyed) by hundreds of camels
and mares, as he bent the forepart of his body before him, and
addressed him (this) speech-
33. What wonder is there (i. e. it is no wonder ) if the earth
yields the desires of a monarch who abides by his duty? But in-
comprehensible is your power, since by you even heaven itself
was milked (made to grant) your desired object.
34. Any other benediction (than that, of issue) would be a
repetition (superfluous) to you who have attained all blessings."
