33. (Ever) longing for the birth of a son from her, his worthy
consort, he passed his days in hopes, the realization of which was
long delayed.
34. With a view to perform some religious rite that he might
obtain a son, he took down from his arms the heavy yoke of the
world (withdrew himself from the heavy task of governing the
world) and entrusted it to his ministers.
35. Then being purified, the two, husband and wife, worship-
ped the Creator of the world with the desire of obtaining a son, and
then started for the hermitage of Vasishtha, their spiritual guide.
36. They drove in a single chariot which made a deep but
agreeable sound, and (therefore) looked like lightning and
Airàvata riding a cloud of the rainy season.
37. That there should be no disturbance to the hermritage, they
took a limited retinue with them; but on account of their peculiar
majesty they looked as if they were surrounded by an army.
38. They were fanned (as they passed on) by breezes of a
pleasant touch, wafting the odour of the exudations of the S'a'la

cocks that raised their necks at (on hearing) the rumbling of the
wheels of the chariot, notes of a double kind and corresponding
(in pitch) to the Shadja air.
40. They observed the similarity of each other's eyes in those
of the couples of deer, that moved a littlefout of the way and had
their eyes riveted on the gliding car.
41. Occasionally they raised their beads (attracted) by the
cranes uttering sweet notes, and forming, as it were, as they flew
in a row, a gateway- garland unsupported by posts.
42. On account of the favourableness of the wind betokening
the fulfilment of their wish, the tresses of the queen and the turban
of the king were not touched by the dust raised by the horses.
43. They smelt the highly-pleasing fragrance of the lotuses
in the tanks, cool by its coming in close contact with the ripples
and imitating (the fragrance of) their breath.
44. In the villages granted by themselves and marked with the
sacrificial posts, they accepted, after they had received the"
