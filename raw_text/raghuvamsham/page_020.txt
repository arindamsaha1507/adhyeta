them in the perfection of his art. Thus Bán bhatta, the famous
author of the Kádambarî, speaks of him in the following words:-
निर्गतासु न वा कस्य कालिदासस्य सूक्तिषु ।
प्रीतिर्मधुरसार्द्रासु मअरीष्विव जायते ॥
"When Kâlidâsa's sweet sayings, charming with sweet sentiment,
went forth, who did not feel delight in them as in honey-laden
flowers?" Kumarils, who flourished about the first half of the eighth
century, has quoted with approval the passage from the Sâkuntala,
सतां हि संदेहपदेषु वस्तुषु प्रमाणमन्तःकरणप्रवृत्तयः. There is a Subháshita
which says :-
पुरा कवीनां गणनाप्रसङ्गे कनिष्ठिकाऽधिष्ठितकालिदासा ।
अद्यापि तत्तुल्यकवेरभावादनामिका साऽर्थवती बभूव ।
“ While once the poets were being counted, Kalidasa ( as being the
first) occupied the last finger. But the ring-finger remained true
to its name (अनामिका = nameless ), since his second has not yet been
found (by whom it can be occupied )". Paudit Govardhanachârya
thus speaks of our poet :-
साकूतमधुरकोमलविलासिनीकण्ठकूजितप्राय ।
शिक्षासमयेऽपि मुदे रतलीलाकालिदासोक्ती ॥
“ Two things only, viz. love-sport and Kalidása's poetry, delight
the heart even at the time of instruction, as they mostly consist of the
sweet, tender and touching words of a sportful girl " Almost
every Pandit has in his mouth the following memorable verse-
काव्येषु नाटकं रम्यं तत्र रम्या शकुन्तला
तत्रापि च चतुर्थोऽङ्कस्तत्र श्लोकचतुष्टयम् ॥
"Among Kávyas the drama is the most charming. Among dramas
Śákuntala is specially charming. Even there the fourth Act is the best;
and lastly, four slokas 13 therein are especially most beantiful". Tho
highest place is assigned to Kálidása among poets for the construc-
tion of happy similes, when it is said-
उपमा कालिदासस्य भारवेरर्थगौरवम् ।
दण्डिनः पदलालित्यं माघे सन्ति त्रयो गुणाः ॥
Among later writers, Jayadeva has called our poet कविकुलगुरु ' the
lord of poets' and the Tor 'Graceful Play' of the Muse of Poetry,¹
That his countrymen should place him at the head of all
Sanskrit poets, unparalleled and unsurpassed by those who have
13 They are —यास्यत्यय शकुन्तलेति &c.; शुश्रू/स्व गुरून् &c.; अभिजनवतो भर्तुः श्लाव्ये
&c.; and भूत्वा चिराय चतुर तमही सपत्नी &c.
14 भासो हास कविकुलगुरुः कालिदासो विलासः ।"
