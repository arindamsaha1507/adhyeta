(55)
22. The hair on the wrist of the bridegroom stood on end
while the fingers of the bride became moist with perspiration; so
it seemed that by the joining of their hands, the action of love
was, at that moment, equally divided between them.
23. Their eyes eagerly longing to see each other which were
casting sidelong glances but were withdrawn the moment they
met, experienced a charming constraint of bashfulness.
24. By going round the blazing fire keeping it on their right
side, that couple, now united to each other, glowed like day and
night revolving round Meru, and following each close upon the
other.
25. The bashful bride, with heavy (fully developed) hips and
eyes like those of an impassioned chakora bird, being directed by
that spiritual guide (of the royal family), the very image of
Brahmá, made an offering of fried grain to the (sacred) fire.
26. There issued from the fire the holy smoke charged with
the smell of oblations, S'amí leaves and fried grain; which, as

king Bhoja with his kindred, and by the matronly ladies having
their husbands and sons living.
29. Having thus finished the connubial rite of his sister, the
opulent monarch, the light of the race of Bhoja, ordered the
officers to honour every one of the (other) kings separately.
30. Those (kings) concealing their malice by external
signs of joy, and resembling (thereby) clear lakes with alligators
hidden from view, bade adieu to the king of Vidarbha and depart-
ed, having requited the honour done to them by him under the
guise of (wedding) presents...
31. That multitude of kings, who had preconcerted a plan for
the accomplishment of their object, remained barring the path of"
