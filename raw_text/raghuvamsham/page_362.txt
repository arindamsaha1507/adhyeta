[Canto VIII.
33. Now (at this time), Nárada was passing along the path of
the sun's return from the north to wait upon, with the music of
his lute, the God S'iva who had taken up his residence in the
temple at Gokarna on the shores of the southern ocean.
34. It is said that an impetuous blast took away, as if through
the desire for its fragrance, the garland made of celestial flowers
which was placed (hanging) on the top of his lute.
35. The lute of the sage, which was surrounded by bees follow-
ing the flowers, appeared, as it were, to be shedding tears
caused by the violence done by the wind and mixed (lit. soiled)
with collyrium.
36. The heavenly garland, which surpassed the vernal splend-
our of the creepers by means of its excessive honey and fragrance,
obtained a good place (or, a firm footing) on the nipples of the
large breasts of the king's beloved.
37. The beloved wife of the king, agitated at the sight of the
garland, the momentary companion of her well-formed breasts,

she made her lord (husband) also drop down. Verily, the flame of
a lamp comes to the earth along with a drop of dripping oil.
39. Frightened at the confused cries of distress of the servants

(collection of) lotuses began to cry, as if they were their fellow-
sufferers (in sympathy, as it were ).
40. The swoon of the king was removed by means of fanning,
and the like, but she remained in that very state (of lifelessness )
The application of a remedy is successful only when there is a
residue of life.
41. The king, who was very fond of his wife, having held her
up, whose condition, on account of the loss of life, resembled that
of a lute which is to be stringed, placed her on his lap to which
she was familiar.
42. Her husband appeared, on account of her who was lying
on his lap and whose complexion had faded owing to the loss of
the senses, like the moon at dawn bearing the dim deer-like mark.
43. Having given up even his natural firmness he began to cry
in accents choked by tears (in a tone faltering through the flow of"
