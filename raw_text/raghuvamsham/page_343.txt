grees of kings, took the princess, first of all, to the presence of the
king of the Magadhas, and thus spoke-
21. This is the king who rules over the Magadha land-the
refuge of those who look up to him for protection, of spirit
unfathomable, and renowned for governing his people well-
Paramtapa by name, true to the sense.
22. Granted that there are other kings by thousands; but the
earth is said to have a pious ruler in him alone. True that the
night is crowded with constellations, stars and planets; but it is
by reason of the moon alone that it has light (is illumined ).
23. This king having to invite Indra (lit. the god with a
thousand eyes) incessantly (to the earth), on account of the un-

ene lotus to another;
27. and spoke to her-this is the lord of the Angas, whose
youthful beauty had been coveted by (enamoured) the damsels of
heaven, and who, having his elephants trained by the founders of
the elephautine science, enjoys Indra's position though on earth.
28. He, causing drops of tears as big as pearls to roll about on-
the bosoms of the wives of his enemies. gave them back, as it were,
their pearl necklaces without threads that had been first taken off.
29. The two goddesses, S'rî (of wealth) and Sarasvati (of
learning), who by nature occupy two different stations, live in
harmony in him; and you, O blessed princess, by reason of your"
