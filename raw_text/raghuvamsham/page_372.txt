"(74)
[ Canto. IX..
women, sore with wounds (from the teeth) and which expelled
the girdle from its place (the loins); he rarefied it only.
33. The young mango-tree (smiling) with buds, and with its
sprouts shaken by the breeze from the Malaya mountain, and
appearing (thereby) as if intent on practising pantomimic move-
ments (acting), delighted (or, inflamed with passion) the minds.
even of those who had subdued hatred and passion.
34. The measured notes, first uttered by the cuckoos in the
rows of forests in full blossom sweet with odour, were heard like
the very rare (moderate) talk of young bashful females.
35. The creepers at the borders of the gardens (or, groves)
which had the humming of the bees pleasant to the ear for their
songs and the flowers for the melow splendour of the teeth,
appeared, by means of the sprouts shaken by the wind, to be as
it were, possessed of hands keeping time in music.
36. The fair ladies merrily drank wine, the friend of love,
which excelled the Bakula flowers in sweet smell and which was
clever (or able) in giving rise to graceful amorous actions, in such
a manner as not to mar (come in the way of the pleasure of) their
love sports with their husbands.
37. The pleasure-ponds attached to the houses, with lotuses
full blown and with birds-fond-of-water uttering sweet but
indistinct notes under the influence of passion, appeared beauti-
ful like women with countenances rendered more lovely by smiles
and with their girdles jingling by being loosened.
38. The Night-lady, wronged (cut-short) by the spring and
with the colour of her face palish owing to the rise of the cool-
rayed (wanting in ardent love) moon grew thin (i. e. short) like a
youthful damsel that does not obtain the happiness of the coveted
company (of her lover).
39. The moou enlivened (excited) the God of Love whose
flag is distinguished by the shark, by means of his rays which
removed the fatigue caused by sexual enjoyment and whose light
was bright on account of the disappearance of (the intervening)
mist.
40. The young women wore in their hair the flower (implanted
by their lovers), whose brightness resembled that of the sacrificial
fire (blazing with oblations), which was in place of (served as )
a golden ornament to Sylvan-beauty, and which was teuder in
the (i. e. which had tender) petals and filaments."
