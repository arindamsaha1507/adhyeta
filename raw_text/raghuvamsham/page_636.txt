[ Canto X.
gaf performed by Rishyas'riga there arose from the sacrificial
fire a being of awful might and wondrous splendour; he was
robed in red and adorned with celestial ornaments, bright like the
sun and glorious like burning fire. He thus addressed the king-
माजापत्यं नरं विद्धि मामिहाभ्यागतं नृप। ...इदं तु नृपशादूल पायसं देवनिर्मितम् । प्रजा
करं गृहाण त्वं धन्यमारोग्यवर्धनम् । भार्याणामनुरूपाणामश्नीतेति प्रयच्छ व &c.
-Cf. उदियाय ततोस्य कश्चन श्रितचामीकरभाजनं चरुम् । परिगृह्य रूचा परिवल
ज्ज्वलतो रोहितवाजिनः पुमान् | Jan. IV. 3.
51. 51. पयश्चरुं - A comp. of the शाकपार्थिवादि class. पयःपक्क:
चरुः पयश्वरुःः चर्यते भक्ष्यते इति चरुः fr. चर् ( चर गतौ भक्षणे च ) and उ
Upidi. See com. According to Kaiyata means the pot in
which it is prepared; and then secondarily it means the food;
(स्थालीवाची चरुशब्दः । तात्स्थ्यादोदने भाक्तः । )
S'1. 52. rafa, the showerer. The original conception
of Indra regards him as the god of rain, and then as the god of
munificence (the showerer of gifts ). Cf. Rig. ar &c. I. 2. 7. 8.
The Amrita, which was produced the last of all the jewels
obtained from the churned ocean, was brought in a Kamandalu by
a being of wondrous form, called Dhanvantari. "Both the Vish.
P. and the Mah. Bhâr.", observes Mr. Pandit, "say that the
Ambrosia was appropriated by the gods, but do not say that Indra
received it for them. Wilson's V. P. pages 75,76. Mahabhå-
rata, A'diparva Adh. XXXIV." Kâlidâsa probably follows
some other authority in making Indra directly receive the Amrita,
or refers to him merely as the head of the gods who churned the
Ocean for it.
S'1. 53. &c. cf. the similar passage from Bhatti Kavya
quoted in the foot-note. :--yazanzia, fr. with
(3T).
S'l. 54. :-According to the Râmâ. Dasaratha himself
allotted portions of the heavenly food to each of his three wives.
द्यावापृथिव्योः--also दिवस्पृथिव्योः अहर्पतिः also अहः पतिः, the sun.
See Malli. q--which grows brighter and brighter as the day
- advances. This shows that the queens also were to manifest
more and more brilliant spendour as they advanced in pregnancy.
The comparison with the sun implies great majesty on the part
of the king.
ST. 55. Mr. Pandit has the following note on this.-If Das aratha
had given the whole of the pudding () to Kausalya, Kaikeyi
would have been insulted, since she was, though not his principal queen"
