of his arrows, the large (beautiful) cheeks of the asura females

73. It was he who shared with the Cleaver of the mountains
(Indra) half of his seat, even when he had re-assumed his own noble
form, rubbing his own armlet against that of the god, loosened on
account of his stroking Airávata (the celestial elephant).
74. In his race was born, we are told, the widely renowned
Dilipa, the light of the race, who stopped short of performing a
hundred sacrifices by one, in order to avert the jealousy of Indra.
75. When he was reigning over the earth, even the wind dared
not displace the garments of drunken women fallen asleep on the
road when on their way to the house of merriment; who could
then stretch forth his hand for theft ?

79. Do you choose him who is your equal in birth, beauty and
youth, and in those various virtues of which modesty is the chief;
let the jewel be matched with gold.

lessening her bashfulness, accepted the prince, by casting at him
a bright glance of joy, as if with the marriage-garland..
81. Through her maidenly bashfulness the princess could not
give expression to the love she felt for the young prince; but the
love of that curly-haired damsel, piercing through her slender
frame, manifested itself in the guise of her hair standing on end.
82. The cane-staff-bearer (Sunandá), her companion, finding
her friend in that state, said in jest: Noble lady, let us go to
