41. On hearing this bold (or, significant) speech of the king
of beasts, the king of men ( knowing that) his missile was foiled
by the power of S'iva slackened his disregard of himself.
42. And also (he) spoke in reply to him (the lion ), being
unsuccessful in his attempt to shoot an arrow, which for the first
time knew what failure was, like the wielder of the thunderbolt
(Indra) paralysed by the glance of S'iva, when about to discharge
his weapon.
43. "O lord of beasts, laughable, indeed, is the speech, which I,
whose actions are restrained, am going to utter; but you know the
inward feelings of living beings, and therefore, I will say my say.
44. All adorable to me is that (S'iva ), who is the cause of the
creation, preservation and destruction of all things, animate and
inanimate; I cannot also, on the other hand, allow this property
of my preceptor to be destroyed before me ( my eyes).
45. Be pleased, therefore, to make your subsistence on this
my body, and let this cow of the great sage be liberated, whose
young calf will be anxiously looking for her (return) at the
close of the day."
46. On hearing these words, that attendant of S'iva (lit. the
lord of beings) laughed a little and spoke once more to the king
(lit. the lord of riches), rending into pieces the gloom of the
mountain-caves by the gleam (rays) of his teeth.
47. "Sovereignty over the world marked by one imperial
umbrella, prime youth, and this handsome form-you who wish
to forego all these for the sake of a trifle, seem to me to be want-
ing in discernment.
48. If this be your compassion for living beings, this cow
alone will be happy (saved) by your death. But if alive, O
king of men, you, like a father, will ever protect your subjects
from calamities.
49. Now if you dread your preceptor, who having an only cow,
will be burning with anger at your offence, (like a blazing ) fire, it
is possible for you to pacify his wrath by presenting him with
crores of cows with udders as big as pitchers.
50. Preserve, therefore, your mighty body, the enjoyer of
blessings: for the wise say that a prosperous kingdom is identical
with the heaven of Indra, only differing in that it is situated on
the earth.""
