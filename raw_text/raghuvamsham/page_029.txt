at the account, Dilipa accords his son a hearty welcome when he
goes back to his court. A short while after he installs Raghu on the
throne as King, and himself retires, with his queen, to the forest,
as was the wont of the kings of Ikshvâku's race.
OANTO IV. King Raghu now begins to rule, and all are made
to feel his equal justice and cautious vigilance. When autumn
comes, Raghu decides to start upon an expedition of conquost
(Dig-vijaya). Proceeding first to the east, he marches right
up to the eastern ocean, where he vanquishes the Submas and the
Vangas. Crossing the river Kapiśâ he goes through Utkala to
the Kalinga country. He conquers its ruler and then marches
to the south. After subduing the Pandya kings there, he crosses
the Sahya mountain, and subjugates the Aparânta districts along
the western coast. Then by land he proceeds northwards, where
he conquers the Pârasikas. Thence he traverses as far as the
Sindhu river, where he defeats the Húnas and the Kâmbojas.
Thence he proceeds across the Himálayas, where he brings the
Utsavasamketas under his sway. Descending to the plains he
finally conquers Prâgjyotisha and Kámarúpa, and returns to
his capital laden with glory and wealth. He then performs the
Visvajit sacrifice (indicative of universal conquest ), in which
he gives away to Brahmaṇas (by way of Dakshiņá) everything that
he possessed.
CANTO V. While Raghu had thus practically beggared him-
self in the Visvajit sacrifice, an ascetic called Kautsa came to him.
He wanted money, as much as fourteen crores, to enable him to
pay his guru his tuition fees. Raghu had nothing with him,
but he did not like to have it said of him that a supplicant, not
gaining his object from Raghu, had to seek it from some other
person. In order, therefore, to satisfy Kautsa's demand, he planned
an expedition against Kubera, the God of wealth, to obtain the
money from him. Divining his intention Kubera filled Raghu's
treasury with a shower of gold during the night, and Raghu gave
all that to Kautsa. The latter, departing, blessed his benefactor
that he would soon obtain a valiant son. This son is then born,
and is named Aja. When Aja, who is properly educated, reaches the
marriageable age, a messenger comes to Raghu from King Bhoja of
the Vidarbha country to invite the prince to be present at the
Svayamvara ceremony of his sister, Indumatî, which was shortly
to take place. The invitation is accepted and Aja goos
