"the hands of all except human beings, whom he despised and hence
had left out of the boon. Vishnu, therefore, promises that he would
be born as a man, as a son of King Dasaratha of Ayodhya, and
that at his hands Râvana would meet death. Now, out of the fire
of that sacrifice which was being performed for Dasaratha, there
arises a being who gives consecrated food (charu) to the King,
who gives it to his three wives. Into this food Vishnu had entered
spiritually, and thus Dasaratha's wives, who conceive afterwards,
all bear sons who are partial incarnations (avatáras) of Vishnu,
Rama was the eldest of them, bora of Kausalya. Of Kaikeyi
was born Bharata, and of Sumitra were born the twins, Lakshmaṇa
and Satrughna.
CANTO XI. The sage Visvâmitra, who wanted protection
from demons in his sacrificial work, now comes to Daśaratha with a
request that the King should send Ráma with him for that purpose.
Accordingly Ráma, and also Lakshmana, accompany Viśvamitra
to his hermitage; on their way Râma kills the demoness Tâḍaká.
In the hermitage of Visvâmitra, Râma routs the demons after
having killed their leaders Subáhu and Maricha. On the completion
of his sacrifice, Viśvâmitra goes to Mithilâ at the invitation of
king Janaka of that city, taking with him the two princes. On
their way Rama restores to her original form Ahalyâ, the wife of
Gautama, who had been cursed by him to be reduced to the form
of a stone. On reaching Mithilá, Visvámitra tells Janaka that
Ráma was anxious to see the famous bow in his possession. It
had been announced that whoever should succeed in bending that
bow, would be given Janaka's daughter, Sîtâ, in marriage. No
king had yet succeeded in bending the bow, and Janaka wondered
mere boy should dare to make the attempt. Râma, how-
ever, bends the bow, and with such force that it cracks; he thus wins
the princess Sîtá for his bride. Dasaratha is then invited to Mithila,
whon Râma is married to Sîtâ; her sister is given to
Lakshmana, and Bharata and Satrughna were married to the two
nieces of Janaka. On their way back to Ayodhyá, they are
stopped by the Brâhmaṇa Parasurama, who had vowed vengeance
on all Kshatriyas, and whose anger was stirred into action on
hearing of that bow-breaking exploit of Râma, a Kehatriya. He,
therefore, challenges Râma to bend his (Parasurama's) bow, which
was stronger than that of Janaka. Râma bonds that too, and humbles
the pride of Parasurama, who recognizes in his adversary the
