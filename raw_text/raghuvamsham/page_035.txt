They sing the Rāmāyaṇa in the presence of Rama, and charm all
by their sweet singing as also by the majesty of their demeanour.
Râma is then told that they are his sons, and Vālmîki then
asks him to take back Sîtá. Râma agrees to do it if she would
satisfy the public about her purity. Sitá, therefore, calls upon the
Earth to receive her in her bosom, if she (Sîtâ) was really and
truly pure. The Earth then appears in corporeal form and
takes off Sîtâ, whom Ráma thus loses for ever, although he gets his
two sons.
After a time Râma begins to feel his end approaching.
He puts his brothers, nephews and sons in charge of separate,
small principalities. Lakshmana dies, and soon Ráma also leaves
this world of mortals and ascends to heaven, after having completed
his special work here.
CANTO XVI. After the death of Râma, his son Kusa, who
ruled in the city of Kuśâvatî, is visited in a dream by the
guardian deity (Adhidevatâ) of the city of Ayodhya, which
being kingless lay now a deserted ruin. She invites him to
come back to his father's capital and to re-people it and restore
it to its former glory. He consents, and coming back to
Ayodhyâ re-endows it with its former splendour, and rules
there in future. Once, while he is sporting in the river
Sarayû, his bracelet drops in its waters and sinks to the
bottom. He orders the river to be searched, but the ornament
could not be recovered; at the suggestion that it was probably
taken by the Nága Kumuda, who resided in a part of the river,
Kusa takes up a missile (astra) to destroy the Nâga, who
hurriedly comes up, leading by the hand his sister Kumudvatî.
It was she who had taken the bracelet in curiosity. Kumuda
requests Kusa to accept his sister as his wife; Kusa agrees
and the two are then married.
CANTO XVII. Kusa gets from Kumud vatî a son, called Atithi,
who ascends the throne on the death of his father, who was killed
in a fight with the demon Durjaya. Atithi is possessed of
great political wisdom, and the Canto describes at some length
some of the main principles of the science of Polity (Raja-Niti)
which Atithi sedulously acted upon.
CANTO XVIII. This Oanto barely enumerates, without any
illuminating details, the various kings, twenty-one in all, that
succeeded Atithi. They were Nishadha, Nala, Nabhas, Pandarika,
Kshemadhanvan, Devánika, Ahînagu, Páriyátra, Sila, Unnâbha,"
