the Asuras got the upper hand and became turbulent, they, aided
by their power of assuming any form at will and flying into the
sky, disturbed the sacrifices of the Brahmanas and defiled and
prevented the oblations thrown into the fire from reaching the gods.
Cf. infra XI. 1, 25; and Kum. II. 46. Mr. Pandit says-
The oblations thrown into the fire for the gods may be carried off
by the Asuras, who always watch incognito to get an opportuniry
of carrying them off. Means are prescribed whereby the oblations
may be prevented from being seized and misappropriated by the
Asuras, and whereby they may reach the gods. Thus:-agen

who thus form a species of subordinate gods being included under
the title Vis'vedevas. The term does not signify here gods in

'in the sky.' gq-The celestial vehicle of Kubera, forcibly
snatched from him by Râvana. The very sight of it had become
a terror especially to the Punyakrits, they being not familiar with
the terrors arising from the demons.

-The damsels of heaven (not wives of the
gods). See Kum. II. 61. -The hairs of chaste women
who are separated from their husbands or lovers are neither
combed nor decorated during the time of separation, but are tied
up into a braid once for all. See foot-note. arafa &c.--
