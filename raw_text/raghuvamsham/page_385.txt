रघुवंशः - रघूणां वंशा रघुवंशः the race of the Raghus, the solar dynasty
of kings; and then by उपचार (transference of an epithet ) तदाख्यः
प्रबन्धः the composition which describes रघुवंश; and since the word
ay is in the mas. gender we get the form . That the poet
intended to designate his work by some mas. title appears from his
line ' : '&c. where Malli. supplies the word
6
"
as referred to by the demonstrative pronoun
6
The authority for forming the titles of literary works is the
Sútra à ïà' ( Páṇ. IV. 3, 87) and the Vârt. on it, viz.,
लुबाख्यायिकाभ्यो बहुलम्. But the Sütra and the Vartiks do not apply
in the present case.
Nor can we add अणू by कृते ग्रन्थे ( IV. 3. 116 );
for then we shall get :. The title, therefore, ought to be
explained like ''the name of the venerable Sankaracharya's
Bhashya on the Vedánta-Sâtra of Bâdaráyana. In trying to explain
this, Bhaṭṭoji Dikshita remarks-îrý vogíaí æ "the
word which means 'the soul' signifies the Bhashya by
transference of an epithet." "कुमारसंभव,' 'रत्नावली' and other similar
names ought to be explained similarly.
Agreeably to the canon of poetics which lays down that "Every
poetic composition should open with (a verse or verses expressive
of) a blessing pronounced on its readers or a salutation by the author
to his favourite deity, or the hinting of the subject-matter"* the
Raghuvamsa opens with a salutation by the poet to S'iva and Párvatî,
who, according to the verse quoted in his introduction by Malli.
from the Váyupurâna, ought to be invoked by those desirous of
poetic fame.
:
S'1. 1. truffa is a compound word and not, as some might be
led to think, two words. 'af' by itself cannot be syntactically
connected either with or with fa, and Malli. rightly considers
the two words and as forming an adverbial compound
(अव्ययसमास ) modifying the sense of संपृक्तौ ( कथं संपृक्तौ वागर्थाविव ).
'आशीर्नमस्क्रियावस्तुर्निर्देशो यापि तन्मुखम् | Dandin.
↑ वाक् च।र्थश्च वागर्थौ । According to the general rule the word अर्थ ought to
precede . But since the word is classed under the
have . According to the Vṛittikâra
group we
is also correct."
