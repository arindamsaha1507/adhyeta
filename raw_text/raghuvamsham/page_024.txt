and Mátrigupta, lit. protected by the motber,' may also be taken
as Kâligupta or Kâlidâsa); (3) and the supposed astronomical
references in the works of Kâlidâ a to the astronomical theories of
A'ryabhata, who lived in 476 A. D. Prof, R. N. Apte has examined
all these at some length, and on the first point he comes to the
conclusion that Dinnâga and Nichala were not contemporaries of
the great Kalidâs, but must have been contemporaries of some
other Kálidása. On the second point he observes that Mátrigupta
and Kálida'sa were two different persons, since they are differently
quoted by Kshemendra and other writers and commentators. The
supposed astronomical references have really no astronomical
significance at all, and it cannot be said that Kálidása was acquainted
with the astronomical works of A'ryabhata. Mr. K. B. Pathak,
the latest exponent of the 6th century theory, repeats the arguments
given above, but principally bases his conclusion on his theory
about the Húna kings, allusion to whom is made by the poet in the
Raghuvamsa. He argues that since there is no mention made
of the Húnas in the Rámâyan, the conclusion follows that
Kálidása unconsciously refers to the Hu'na kings of his own time,
who held sway over the Punjab and Kashmir, in the second quarter
of the sixth century. But this rests merely on assumption; for
there are references to the Húnas even in the Mahabharata. Prof.
Apte has also shown that just beyond Bactria or the threshold of
ancient India, the Hûnas had constituted a powerful empire from
the middle of the 3rd century B. O. to the end of the 1st or the
2nd century A. D.
Modern European scholars are generally inclined to hold that
Kâlidâsa must have flourished under one or more of the Gupta
kings. The Gupta period (about 300-650 A. D.) was noted in
ancient Indian history for a revival of Sanskrit learning and arts.
The late Mr. Vincent A. Smith (see his Early History of India
p. 304, 3rd ed. 1914) believed that Kâlidâsa must have lived in
the reigus of the first two, or even in that of the third, of the Gupta
Kings:-
Chandragupta II. (c. 357-413)
Kumâragupta I. (413-455)
Skandagupta (455-480)
Both Chandragupta II. and Skandagupta had adopted the title
of Vikramadity. To quote the words of Mr. Smith, "It is not
unlikely that the earliest works of Kalidasa............ may have been"
