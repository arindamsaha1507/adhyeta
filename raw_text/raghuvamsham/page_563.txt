(179)
S1. 8. जालान्तर &c. - जालान्तरे-न्तरेण (through the openings of )
the latticcs वा प्रेषिता दृष्टिर्यया । प्रस्थान - -Her quick gait, rapid motion.
-The word gfe indicates depth of the navel, which is
considered to be a mark of beauty. Cf. supra ‘¾ªÃ¤Ãìşan:' VI. 52
अर्द्धाचिता – अर्द्धमाचिता half-strung; & comp. सुप्सुपा.
V. 1. अर्धाञ्चिता – अञ्चू takes इ before त in the sense of पूजा or honour;
so this means 'half-graced' which it could not be without being
woven; hence, half-woven or half-strung. -P. p. p, of ſa
$1. 10.
5 U. to measure, to throw, with and ; ill-measured, ill-
placed: दुरः षत्वणत्वयोरुपसर्गत्वप्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः । इति न णत्वम्. रशना – ( also
written as ), from or to make a sound, is a girdle
consisting of several strings of pearls or gems or beads; cf. gr
व्यष्टिर्भवेत्काञ्ची मेखला त्वष्ट यष्टिकाः । रसना षोडश ज्ञेयाः कलापः पञ्चविंशतिः ॥ But
this distinction is dispensed with in practice; see Mâl. III. 20, 21.
अङ्गुष्ठ &c.-A certain lady was putting together her waist-band,
here of one string, one end of the thread being attached to her
big toe. But as soon as she heard of the procession approaching,
she ran up to the windows witnout securing that portion of the
waist-band which was strung, and so all the gems or pearls dropped
down and the string only remained hanging from her toe.
S'. 11. &c. See com. The word f takes qraqra by
the Vārt. गड्वादेः परा सप्तमी । Drinking wine seems to have
been a fashionable vice among the women of even the higher grades
of society in ancient India, notwithstanding the dictum
', as it is often described by poets; cf. infrv VIII.
69, IX. 33, 36, XIX. 12 &c.; Kum. IV. 12; S'is'. II. 20, X. 33 &c.
The poets may have made much of it, but it cannot be merely a
poetical fiction. &c.-This shows that the women remained
stationary and so their faces resembled lotuses the more. Fa
&c. var, yadîíà a The moving eyes served as bees.
It is usual with poets to describe lotuses with black bees hovering
over them. means 'a ray of light;'
- &n oye, i. e. & hole. गवामक्षीणीव गवाक्षाः | अक्षि becomes
of a comp. when it does not mean 'an eye', by
V. 4. 76. So means 'a hole for admitting light,' hence a
window. The word ought to be neu. (see Kâs'ikâ); it is mas. by
custom;
Manoramâ and Tat. Bod. - (i. e.
..s large number of ) पत्राणि एषामिति सहस्रपत्राणि तानि आभरणानि येषां ते ।
$1. 12. ſqa-:—This is an idiom which we have already
met with. See supra II. 19, 73. arģ: 7 :-Women, i. e. of course
something like
अक्ष at the end
