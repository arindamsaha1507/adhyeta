[ Canto. VII.
auother;" thereupon the bride looked at her with a frown of dis-
pleasure.
83. She with beautiful thighs (lit. whose thighs were compara-
ble to the forearm), caused the bridal garland, red with the auspi-
cious powder, to be properly placed round the neck of Raghu's
son, which looked like the very embodiment of her love, by the
hands of her nurse.
34. By that garland, strung with auspicious flowers, and
hanging on his expansive chest, the eligible prince almost felt
that the younger sister of the Vidarbha king had thown her
delicate arms round his neck.
S5. "Here is moon-light united with the moon freed from
clouds; here is the Ganges descended to the sea, the worthy recipient
of its water;" these were the unanimous words, so harsh to the
ears of the kings, which the citizens, delighted at the union of the
two of equal merit, uttered there.
86. That assemblage of kings, having on one side the
party of the bride-groom transported with joy, and on the other
looking sad (with disappointment and despair) was like a lake,
at day-break, having full-blown lotuses at one place, and the
night lilies gone to sleep (closed) at the other.
CANTO VII.
1. Thereafter the lord of the Vidarbha country took with him
his sister united with a worthy bridegroom, like Devasenà hersel
united with Skanda, as it were, and bent his steps towards the
entrance of his city.
2. The (other) lords of the earth too, with their brightness
dimmed like that of the morning stars, went to their respective
camps, reproaching both their personal beauty and dress, having
been disappointed in their hopes with respect to the princess
of Bhoja.
3. Verily owing to the presence of S'achf at the spot there was
an absence of those who would disturb the ceremony of self-elec-
tiou-marriage; it was on account of this that the host of kings,
though full of jealousy towards the descendant of Kakutsha, re-
mained quiet."
