[ Canto III.
(the right leg advanced and the left one drawn in), thus imitating
the god S'iva.
53. The resentful splitter of mountains (Indra) too, struck at
heart by Raghu's shaft consisting of his defiant posture, (or, spirit)
placed an arrow, that never failed to hit its mark, on his bow, which
shows itself as the momentary sigual of the fresh clouds (i. e. the
rainbow).
54. The arrow of Indra, accustomed to drink the blood of ter-
rific demons, entered (penetrated) the broad chest of the son of
Dilfpa, and drank, out of curiosity as it were, the blood of a
human being, never tasted before.
55. The prince also, with the prowess of Kumâra (Kàrtikeya),
planted an arrow, marked with his own name, into Indra's arm,
whose fingers were roughened by patting Airàvata (the celestial
elephant), and which bore the prints of S'achf's ornamental paint-

56. And with another arrow, having peacock's feathers attached
to it, he struck down Indra's great thunderbolt banner; whereupon
the god got mightily wroth with him, as if he had forcibly cropped
off the hair of the deity presiding over the fortune of the celestials.

exceedingly uubearable (irresistible) energy (power), as the
cloud cannot extinguish by its waters the fire (of lightning)
emitted from itself.
59. Then Raghu, by means of an arrow with a head shaped
like the crescent of the moon, cut off the string of Indra's bow,
roaring deep, like an ocean that is being churned, ou his fore-arm,
besmeared with the sandal of heaven.
60. He, with his jealous anger intensified, threw aside the bow,
and with a desire to slay his very powerful adversary, took up
the thunderbolt, blazing with a circle of radiance and accustomed
to clip off the wings of mountains.
61. Severely struck on the breast by that weapon, Raghu fell
on the ground, along with the tears of his soldiers; shaking off in"
