[ Canto VI
charming loveliness and your truthful and pleasing speech, are fit
to be the third of them two.
30. When Sunandá had done, the princess took off her eyes
from the king of Añga, and said to the maid, "Pass onward"; not
that he was not amiable, nor was she unable to appreciate personal
charms; but people differ in their tastes.
31. Then the maid (lit. she who was appointed to keep guard
at the door of the harem), showed to Indumatí, as people show
the newly-risen moon, an exceedingly handsome prince, who was
not to be withstood by his enemies.
32. This is the king of Avanti, having stout and large arms, an
expansive chest, and a slim, rounded waist, who (therefore) looks

by his heat.
37. Then Suuandá led that lovely creation of the Creator (the
princess) in front of the king of Anûpa-she whose complexion
was like that of the inner part of a lotus, who was perfect in all
accomplishments and who had a beautiful set of teeth-and again
spoke to her.
38. In days of yore, there was a king, given to ascetic exercises,
