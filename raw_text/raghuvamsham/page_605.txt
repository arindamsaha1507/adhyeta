"Canto IX. ]
(221)
विश्वसनीयतास्य राज्ञो वपुषः । Sak. II. सोम: -सुते अमृतमिति; fr. सू+म
(Unádi aff.). See notes to II. 73.
S'1. 16. Some editions give the verses gg &c. immediately
after the preceding śloka; but it will be seen that the order follow-
ed here is the most natural one. The śl. ¶¶ can only natura-
ally follow the description of the king's universal conquest, and
the verses descriptive of the king'a marriage must precede those
describing the sacrifices performed by him.
ककुत्स्थ – See note
on the word, supra VI. 71.
॰ कुलोद्भवं – ० कुलादुद्भवतीति; भू with-
उद् + अनू; or • कुलमुद्भवो यस्य; उद्भवत्यस्मादित्युद्भवः आत्मभवं- आत्मनो भवतीति::
cf. X. 20. Taar-Because her chastity remains inviolate
although she waits upon a king, as he is regarded as a portion of
Vishnu. Cf. नादेवांशो ददात्यन्नं नारुद्रो रुद्रमर्चयेत् | नानृषिः कुरुते काव्यं
नाविष्णुः पृथिवीपतिः। भलाघवं -shows that Lakshmi ever abode with
him as she does with Vishnu.
Sl. 17.
-The sea is poetically described as the hus-
band of rivers; cf. XIII. 9; S'is'. III. 72 (arqara qíã¤ıqmai).
for and see notes on I, 31 and III. 5.
The country of the Kekayas (the modern Kattis of Káthiawar are
supposed to be their descedants) bordering on Sindhudeśa and
lying beyond the Jhelum on this side of the Indus. Its capital
was Girivraja; see Rámá., Ayodhyakanda, wherein the journey
of Bharata to the capital of Yudhâjit is described. :-
must be a very old word, a relic of the times when the
A'ryans led a very simple and pious life; it means 'the milker', the
office of the daughter being in those days to milk the cows or
sheep. fac-If this epithet has any propriety here it is
this the kings could not have refused Dasaratha the hand of
their daughters.
8'1. 18. तिसृभिः शक्तिभिः - see note on III. 13. एव - only; accom-
panied only by three powers.
:-implies the good rule
of Dasaratha. :-The god having bay horses.' See supra
III. 43. In Rigveda we find af and gra: (1. 16. 1; 101. 10) for
the horses of Indra. In Nirukta I.. 15 the different vehicles of
the gods are given, and among them 'hars Indrasya.' Hence Indra
is called fg and gfarga ( Vik. III. 6) and in Rigveda hariyojana.
STITE.
