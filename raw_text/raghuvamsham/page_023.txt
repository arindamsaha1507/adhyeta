brought Vikramaditya down to A. D. 544, propounding what was
known as the Korur Theory. The battle of Korur marked a
turning-point in Indian history, Vikramaditya having defeated the
Mlechchhas in it. Curiously enough, Mr. Fergusson held that to
commemorate the battle an era was invented, and that its beginning
was placed back 600 years. So he put the true date of Vikramâditya
at 544 A. D., and this theory for a time held sway, since no
inscription was discovered bearing a date prior to 600 of the Vikrama
era. But the discovery of the Mandasor Inscription, which is dated
Samvat 529, made this theory untenable, and the traditionary
date ramained unshaken. Then there is the theory of the Nine Gems.
Nine eminent men called the Nine Gems' adorned the
court of king Vikramaditya-
धन्वन्तरिक्षपणकामरसिंहशङ्कुबेताल भट्टघट कर्परकालिदासाः ।
ख्यातो वराहमिहिरो नृपतेः सभायां रत्नानि वै वररुचिर्नव विक्रमस्य ||
Of these is said to have lived between 414 A. D. and
642 A. D. Varâhamihira is believed to have died in 587 A. D.
On the strength of these dates of Kalidasa's supposed contem-
poraries, Dr. Kern placed him in the latter half of the sixth
century. But in this there are many a priori conclusions and.
speculations as to probabilities. If the tradition proves anything
definitely, it proves the connexion of Kâlidâsa with King
Vikramaditya; but as regards the contemporaneity of the nine
authors, the tradition cannot be true. Next there is the theory of
Renaissance propounded by Prof. Max Müller. He divided the
whole Sanskrit literary period into two parts. The first began
with the Vedas and ended with the first century A. D. Then came
an interregnum, a period during with foreigners invaded India and
so literary activity was dormant. The Professor placed the
RENAISSANCE of Sanskrit learning in the sixth century A. D. with.
the reign of Vikramâditya. But, as has been shown by Drs. Peterson
and Bühler, the period called interregnum was really not destitute
of literary productivity, and, therefore, if Kâlidâsa is to be
considered as the first post of the new school, he must be placed
considerably earlier than Prof. Max Müller did.
There are some minor things which have been pushed into the
controversy. These are-(1) the alleged covert references to
Dinnâga and Nichula in the Meghadûta, the former a foe and the
latter a friend of Kâlidâsa; (2) the identity of Mâtrigupta, a king
of Kashmir, and Kâlidása (for, names in Sanskrit are often titles,"
