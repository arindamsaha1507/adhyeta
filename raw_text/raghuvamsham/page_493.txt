or Malabar. According to some accounts he stood on the promontory of
Delhi and shot his arrows to the South over the site of Kerala. It seems.
likely that we have proof of the local legend being at least as old as the
beginning of the Christian era, as the Mons Pyrrhus of Ptolomy is, probably,
the mountain of Paras'u or Paras'uráma. (See Wilson's Vistņu Purâņa
p. 404, Note 21 ).

&c.-The women were struck with terror at:
the sudden appearance of Raghu's vast army and gave up decorating
their persons.
-Kerala is the ancient name of the
whole tract comprising the districts of Cochin, Canara, and
Travancore. Dandin says (see Dk. Ull. 8th) that the king of
As'maka or hilly country incited the kings of Kuntala, Konkaṇa,
Vanavâsi, Murala, Richîka, and Nâsikya, to rise in a general revolt
against the king of Vidarbha, and it will appear that Murala is the
name of Kerala. The positions of all these countries except..
As'maka are definitely known and cover all southern India except
Trâvancore. Hence it is clear that As'maka must be the old name
for Travancore. This is confirmed by the fact that it is called
Kâta by some Mahomedan writers, which means the same thing as
Asmaka. The principal rivers in this tract are the Netravati on
which Mangalore stands, the Sarasvatí on which is situated.
Hona war, and the Kálînadî on which Sadâsivagad is situated.
As-
the first two rivers have their distinctive names, the last must be-
the same as the Muralâ referred to by Kâlidâsa in the next Śl. and by
Bhavabhati in his Uttar, III. This is the principal river in Kerala..
and hence the people were sometimes called Muralas. From the
description in the Raghuvams'a and the Kathâsaritsågara, it appears -
that Kerala meant the strip of land between the Western Ghâts
and the sea north of the Kâverî. Popular opinion also fixes its.
northern boundary on the south of Konkan. In Hemachandra's
gloesary Urga is given as a synonym of Kerala.
