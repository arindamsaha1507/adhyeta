[Canto IV.
Yavana ladies. Since Káli. applies the term yavana to the ancient
Persians (and the other tribes on the North-west of India) it is.
clear that the term was not restricted to the Greeks or Ionians
as some Western scholars suppose. The flush imparted by
liquor. The invasion of Raghu struck terror into the hearts of the
Persian ladies, who, though they were habitual drinkers, gave up
drinking wine, so that their cheeks lost the usual glow of liquor.
-the young, i.e., the morning sun. This is added because it is
the morning sun that gives the reddish glow to the lotuses. This
serves to bear up resemblance with the red flush imparted by wine.
&c.-out of the proper (the rainy) season i. e. in autumn,
when a sudden appearance of clouds is not expected. Raghu's
invasion, too, took place at a time (i. e. in autumn) when the
Yavana women were in their best spirits and did not at all expect an
invasion. For & similar idea, cf. देश्यस्त्रीगण्डलेखानां मदरागविलोपिभिः ।

full, to move, to injure', +g; tumultuous.'

-The special feature of the army of the Persians was
their cavalry; and so they are spoken of here as
like the king of the Kalingas who is described as
in l. 40,
and the Vangas as in Śl. 26. There is a distinct
reference to the cavalry of the Persians as being their speciality in the
Mudrâ. मेघाक्षः पञ्चमोस्मिन्पृथुतुरगबल: पारसीकाधिराजः &c. I. 20; see also.
infra V. 73. In fact the Yavanas, inhabiting the North-western
frontier of India, were strong in their horse; cf. : argent

This seems to show that though clouds of dust were raised here
Raghu's skilful marksmen could still hit their enemies, while the
Persians were confused, being blinded.

explains this by referring it to the far class; but the word is not
found in that list. We may therefore explain - १मभ्रूणि लान्तीति श्मभु-
