Each king had a small army with him. See supra V. 49. -
विशिष्टं भातमस्मिन् इति विभातं the dawn ( विभातं is a noun, the त being
added by नपुंसके भावे क्तः ); विभाते ग्रहाः विभातग्रहाः । सह सुपेति समास:; or
विगतं भातं येषां ते विभाता: lustreless; मन्दा भा येषां ते मन्दभासः । विभातग्रहाइक

येषां ते व्यर्थमनोरथास्तेषां भावस्तस्मात् । साभ्यसूयाः - असूया means 'finding
fault with what is good' ( गुणेषु दोषाविष्करणम् ); असूयया सह वर्तमाना:
full of disregard for. They found fault with their beauty and
splendid dresses, because they were of no use as they failed to attract
the princess. Cf. तथा समक्षं दहता मनोभवं पिनाकिना भग्नमनोरथा सती !
निनिन्द रूपं हृदयेन पार्वती प्रियेषु सौभाग्यफला हि चारुता ॥ Kum. V. 1.
81. 3. सांनिध्ययोगात्- Hore योग means her सद्भाव existence or pre-
zence in all her majesty, the affix being added ; see Sanj.
S'achí being duly invoked was present there (a) in all her
majesty, and consequently there was an utter absence of disturbers of
the Svayamvara. Unless we understand the word in this sense,
it becomes meaningless. For, the mere presence of S'achi is no gua-
rantee against disturbance being created in a Svayamvara. For we
know that despite the presence of S'achí serious disturbances did take
place in the Svayamvara of the daughters of the king of Kâs'î, who
were borne away by Bhishma, as well as in that of Lakshmi and
Draupadi. -Either implies an or tradition, or an histori-
cal fact (fa). : At the beginning of a Hindu marriage rite, it
is customary to invoke S'achí ( and her husband) to be present. The
reason why S'achi's presence was (and is) prayed for seems to be to
obtain perpetual freedom from widowhood, which the goddess is
supposed to enjoy, as well as progeny, woalth, fortune &c. In the
Tait. Samh. Indrání or S'achî is represented as the best of wives,
as one than whom nothing is more excellent, and whose husband
aever dies by age. इन्द्राणीमासु नारीषु सुपत्नीमहमश्रवम् । न ह्यस्था अपरं च न
star arà qiâ: 1 1. 7. 13. Again in the Tait. Brâh, she is represented
as ever free from widowhood. 'इन्द्राणीवाविधवा अदितिरिव सुपुत्रा'
Kând. III. Prap. 7, Anu. 5. Das'. 10. Náráyaṇabhatta in his
Prayoga Rat, says at a &c.; see ft.-note. -interruption
of, disturbance in. aa- with reference to, regarding. ER T:—
azt az adata: jealous. -by that i. e. because of the deterrent
effect which S'achi's presence had on all disturbers of the
Svayamvara."
