with her and would not blaze up, even though forcibly fanned, till
agitated by tho gentle breath of that girl's fair lips. Agni made
confession of his love to her and his suit was accepted by the girl
herself. Agni accordingly assumed the form of a Bráhmana and
used to enjoy the company of the king's fair daughter. One day
this being discovered by the king he ordered the Bráhmana to be
punished according to the law. Upon this the god flamed up in
wrath. The king much marvelling at this fell down at the feet
of the deity in the Bráhmana's disguise and respectfully bestowed
his daughter upon him. Whereupon the deity being graciously
pleased with the king asked him to name a boon. The king begged
that his soldiers should ever be safe in battles.

क्षत्रियकाल &c. - कालस्य रात्रिः कालरात्रि: the night at the end of a
kalpa, when the whole universe is destroyed and which is terrific on
account of the oceanic and the atmospheric waters mingling tog-
ther to assist in the work of destruction, with terrible flashes of
lightning, &c. iqat sê: q: The poet mentions
the because the axe is also of a dark colour. This alludes
to Paras'uráma's having cleared the earth of the Kshatriyas
twenty-one times. After Paras'urâma killed Kártavirya (sce
note under 38), the sons of the latter, in retaliation, attacked the
hermitage of Jamadagni while Paras'uráma was out and slew the
pious, unresisting sage. When Paras'urâma came back and saw
what had happened, he took a vow to extirpate the whole race
of the Kshatriyas including the sons of Kártavirya. He accord-
ingly destroyed the Kshatriyas thrice seven times, filling with their
blood the five lakes of Samantapanchaka (Kurukshetra) from
which he offered libations to the race of Bhrigu. He then performed
an As'vamedha sacrifice and presented the earth to Kas'yapa.
