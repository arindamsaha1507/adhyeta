power in him to undo what had been done. - Hit:
महिमा तेन.

-causing sleep, hypnotic.
-&c.-Here
and i do not mean merely the shooting or the thrusting
back into the quiver of an arrow. a means the repetition of a
certain mantra to endow the arrow with a peculiar virtue which
enables it to assume a particular form or to bring about a certain
result; while & means the repetition of the counter-mantra which
takes away from the arrow the peculiar virtue it was endowed
with and it becomes again an ordinary arrow. See also note on
III. 64. -The Mantra for which has two parts; one for its
employment, the other for its withdrawal. आवत्स्व -- दा with
3r is Atm. except in the sense of 'opening'; see Sid. Kau. on

conj. to entreat, gåsaæ--çª`❀ capable of being employed;
by the rule 'प्रयोज्यनियोज्यौ शक्यार्थे' -the words प्रयोज्य and नियोज्य are
formed only in the sense of capability or practicability
'न कर्तव्यम्' but then we shall get the form प्रयोग्यम् and not प्रयोज्यम्.
