[ Canto IV.
running from the south of Mysore and forming the eastern boundary
of Travancore. Kálidása in this il. calls the mountains Malaya
and Dardura the breasts of the earth, and Dandin describes the
southerly breeze as cool with the embrace of sandals on the sides
of the mountain Dardura. The two mountains are also spoken of
in one connexion in the Mark. P. Dardura, therefore, must be that
portion of the Ghâts which forms the south-eastern boundary of
Mysore. The sources of four rivers are placed in this chain, viz.
Kritamâlá, Tâmraparní, Pushpaja and Utpalâvatî,
S1. 52. असह्यविक्रमः - सोडुमशक्योऽसह्यः विक्रमो यस्य | सह्यम् – One of
the seven principal chains of mountains in India. It is still known
as Sahyadri and is the same as Western Ghâts, as far as their junc-
tion with the Neilgherries north of the Malaya.
-reached
or crossed. The two S'lokas form a gun.
S'1. 53. ST" is originally the face; and meaning then
the edge of any sharp weapon, it signifies, like the Latin acies, the
sharp edge or edgelike appearance of an army in march i. e. a row.
In classical Sanskrit the word only bears one signification derived
from the last, viz., that of 'multitude' or army." S. P. Pandit.
विसर्पद्भिः—marohing. अपरान्तः- अपरोन्तः अपरान्तः the other side, i. e.
the West (said with reference to the East). 3: the westerner
(: Vall.). Konkan is the name of the strip of land between
Sahya mountains and the sea, particularly the portion lying between
Daman on the North and Goa on the South. arcata:-The
Râma referred to here is Parasuráma. He destroyed the Kshatriyas
twentyone times and then made a gift of the earth, which was his
by the right of conquest, to Kasyapa, as dakshina in a sacrifice.
After this Parasuráma wished to practise religious austerities.
But now he found himself in a fix, for no merit accrues from
penance practised on another's ground, and all the land then
.available in the world belonged to Kaśyapa. So he applied to the
ocean for space. The ocean told him to raise land by removing the
water if he could. This was no difficult task for a warrior like
Parasurama. He took up his bow and shot anarrow, with the result
that the waters of the sea receded from the vicinity of Sahyadri,
relinquishing the maritime district, named Surpåraka, according to
the Mah. Bhâr. See also the passage quoted from the Mah. Bhår.
in the foot-note.
The traditions of the Peninsula ascribe the formation of the coast of
Malabar to this origin and relate that Paraa'urâma compelled the ocean to
retire and introduced Brâlimanas and colonists from the north into Kerala"
