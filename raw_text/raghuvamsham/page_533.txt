"Canto VI. ]
S1. 16. आसनार्धे - आसनस्यार्थः एकदेशस्तस्मिन् | Here अर्ध does not
I mean exactly a half,' but a part only. The word
meaning a half
(149)
is of the neu. gender and is placed first in a Gen. Tat.
-
the small of the back, or the part near the lower end of the
spine; or it may better mean 'the part of the spine between the
shoulder-blades.' -divided i. e. fallen on either side, or rolled
round (goza:) according to Malli. - p q | The
word and a meaning a friend and a foe respectively, are
derived from सु and दुर् prefixed to हृदय, by 'सुहृद्दुर्हृदौ मित्रामित्रयोः' Pan.
V. 4 150. If we expound as
we shall get the word
but then the meaning will be one with a good heart' (just
like :), and not necessarily 'a friend.' The king placed his
left hand on his throne and reclining on it turned to his neighbour
to converse with him. This raised his left shoulder and depressed
the right one, and thus brought the back in a position to receive
the displaced long necklace of pearls. This act of the king
indicates the nervousness he felt when the princess presented
herself.
Ś1 17. kind of ear-ornament made of ivory
(probably of the form of the folded Ketaki which is worn
in the. hair of the head by women ). आपाण्डुरम् - पाण्डुरस्यास्तति
पाण्डुरम् | आ ईषत्पाण्डुरमापाण्डुरम् | This action of the king shows that
he was extremely beside himself, being under the power of the
intensity of his feelings. According to Chári travardhana it
indicates his proficiency in the Erotic science.
S'1. 18. कुशेशय - कुशे जले शेते इति कुशेशयम् । 'शरं वनं कुशं नीरम्' इति
1 Now see Sanj. This is a sign of delicacy and beauty.
रेखा ध्वज – रेखानिर्मितो ध्वजः रेखाध्वजः &c. This is one of the linear
marks of royalty said to be found on the palms or soles. Car
according to Mallinátha's exposition this will mean 'rings made
of gems;' it is better, however, to take this as a comp. of the
शाकपार्थिवादि class-रत्नखचितान्यङ्गुलीयानि रत्नाङ्गुलीयानि | उदीरयामास-threw
up; perf. of the caus. to go, to move, 2nd Atm.; for a different
sense cf. supra II. 9. This was only a feint used by the king to
prevent others from guessing his feelings by observing his features.
