and the Ganges, the Kâveri and the Indus rivers. In the 6th,
Canto, on the occasion of describing the various kings assembled
in Kandina, the capital of the Vidarbhas in Central India, the
principal provinces of India have naturally been mentioned; these
are Magadha, Anga, Avanti, Anûpa, Súrasena, Kalinga, Pandya
and Uttara-Kosala. As all the chief princes were expected:
to have come there, it is almost certain, as observed by Mark
Collins, 27 that we may see in this list a reflex of the principal
kingdoms of India in the times of Kâlidâsa." The 13th Oanto-
supplies some additional names of places lying in a straight line
between Ceylon and Ayodhyâ; e. g. the mountain Mályavat, the lake
Pampâ, the river Godávarî, the mountain Chitrakûṭa and the rivers
Yamanâ. and Sarayû. The description of many of these places is
far from being conventional or traditional; it very often reads like
such as would be given by an eye-witness, and it is pretty certain
that our poet must have travelled widedly with an observant eye..
No other poet in classical Sanskrit literature has described the
country in such a familiar and vivid manner.
(6) MALLINA THA.
There exist a large number of commentaries on this poem,
but none of them is so well-known or so often studied as that of
Mallinâtha, who enjoys a supreme position as the standard authority.
in the interpretation of Kálidása's poems. While writing about
Kálidása we had to remark above that he says absolutely nothing
about himself in his writings, and the same is true his great
scholiast, Mallinâtha. Pandit Vámanáchárya Zalktîkar, the
editor of the Kâvyaprukása, wrote that Mallinátha was a
Bráhmana of the Kâsyapa gotra, and that his descendants were stili
living at Gajendragad in the Sâtara District. But the learned Pandit
was hasty in his identification; for Mr. M. S. Sâstrî (in his
"Second Report on the Search of Sanskrit MSS.") has shown that
Mallinátha was a native of Tailangana (Andhra), which fact is
now accepted as established. He had a son named Kumárasvámin,
who was also an erudite scholar, and wrote a commentary on the
Pratáparndrîya. In addition to his three commentaries on the
three poems of Kálidása, Mallinátha is credited to have written
(a) commentaries on अमरकोश, एकावली, काव्यादर्श, किरातार्जुनीय, तन्त्र-
वार्तिक, तार्किकरक्षा, नलोदय, नैषधीयचरित,
भट्टिकाव्य,
प्रशस्त पादभाष्य,
