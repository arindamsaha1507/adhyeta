the Ragh. in the life of each king? Are they all historical facts?
The poet has not portrayed for us the whole life of each king, but
only such episodes as suited his poetic purpose or the require-
ments of a Mabâkávya. Thus the bare facts he mentions about
king Dilipa are his childless state, his service of a cow, the birth
of his son Raghu, and his horse-sacrifice. He devotes the first
three Cantos to these, and the parallel account will be found in
the Uttarakhaṇḍa of the Padma-Parana. We forbear from quoting
it here, which the curious student may consult in the original. As
regards the incidents in the lives of Raghu and Aja, no references
can be found in the accounts that have been published till now.
For example, the dig-vijayr of Raghu, the Kautsa episode, the
battle in Canto VII., or the tragio end of Aja's queen in
Canto VIII., have not yet been traced to their sources. Kâlidása
could hardly have invented these, and they must be lying embedded
in accounts that have not yet been brought to light.
From Canto IX. onwards the poet closely follows the Rámâ-
yana. Kâlidâsa was an admirer and a diligent student of the great
epic. Indeed, as has been pointed out by Pandit R. Krishnama-
ohariar,21 the name "Raghuvamsa" of the poem itself seems to have
been directly suggested by, and borrowed from, the Râmāyaṇa,
where it occurs twice (रघुवंशस्य चरितं चकार भगवान्मुनिः I. 3. 9; अहं च
THE SER : VI. 1. 11). It is no wouder, therefore, that
Vâlmiki should have been the model of Kâlidâsa. What changes
he makes in the Râmâyana-account are such as are necessary for
poetic and dramatic effect. Thus in the Ram. Dasaratha shoots the
young ascetic-boy, who dies first, and then the parents are taken
to him by the King; while in the Ragh. the poet makes the boy die
in the presence of his parents, which enhances the tragic effect of
Dasaratha's deed. In Canto X. Kalidása makes the gods approach
Vishnu directly; while in the Râmáyans thoy approach Brahma
first, and then comes Vishnu to whom they repeat their grievances.
In Canto XII. the poet goes over the account very hurriedly, dispos-
ing of important events in single verses and phrases even, 22 as if
anxious not to narrate at length what had been so well narrated by
Válmîki. Even here, some of the accounts differ from those of the
21 In his Raghuvams'avinars'a, Srirangam 1908, p. 130.
22 E. g
The whole story of the purification of Sità in fire he gives
in one single word जातवेदोविशुद्धां (verse 104)."
