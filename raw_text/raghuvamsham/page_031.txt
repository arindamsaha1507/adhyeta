soon as the curse ceased to operate when the garland fell upon
her from heaven, Life being an accident and death the rule, a
firm-minded, wise ruler like Aja, should cease to "brood over his
grief. Thus ran the message, and the King received it dutifully
as coming from his guru, though it had little visible effect upon
him. He spent some eight years more after this, all the while
mourning for his lost wife, whom he finally went to join in the
next world.
CANTO IX. After his father, Dasaratha rules over Ayodhya
as nobly as his predecessors. His greatness was such that even
Indra himself on occasions asked his assistance in his own wars.
Once, having enjoyed all the pleasures of the spring season with
its attendant festivities, he plans a long hunting trip. He spends
several days in that engrossing and delightful sport. One morning
he starts after a deer, alone and without followers. In his pursuit
he comes to the river Tamas치, where he hears the noise of a pot
being filled with water. He mistakes it for the trumpet of a wild
elephant, and discharges an arrow in that direction, aiming at the
sound only, as he could not see the mark. As a matter of fact
a young ascetic-boy was filling his jar there; and the arrow hit
him fatally. His parents, who were blind, were at hand. The
King, who was horrified at what he had unwillingly done, related
to them what had happened. As the boy died, his sorrow-stricken
father cursed the King as the author of his bereavement, with the
words: "You, too, like me, shall die, in your old age, grieving
for your son."
The King had no son then; so he received the
curse as a sort of qualified blessing, since it meant that at any
rate a son was bound to be born to him before he died. The aged
couple burned themselves on the funeral pyre of their son, and
Dasaratha returned to his city, full of grief not unmixed with a
little anticipatory joy at the prospect of a son.
CANTO X. Some ten thousand years pass, but still Dasaratha
remains without the expected son.
At last,
sages proceed
to perform on his behalf a special kind of sacrifice intended to
bring about the birth of a son. Now at about this time it so
happens that the gods, who were continually harassed and persecuted
by the dreaded and powerful demon Ravana, carry their tale of
grievances to their lord Vishnu, who tells them how, by virtue
of a boon given by Brahm치, Ravana was immune from death at"
