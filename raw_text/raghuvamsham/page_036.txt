Vajrauâbha, Sankhana, Vyushitasva, Visvasaha, Hiranyanabba,
Kausalya, Brahmishtha, Putra, Pushya, Dhruvasamdhi and
Sudarśana. The last of these (Sudarsana) ascends the throne when
a young boy of six, his father having been killed by a lion. After he
attains youth he is married.
CANTO XIX. Sudarsana gets a son, Agnivarna by name,
whom he installs king and himself retires into the forest.
Agnivarna turns out to be a voluptuous, pleasure-seeking sensualist.
The Canto describes at length his amorous sports and pastimes.
Agnivarna pays the penalty of having drunk too deep at the fountain
of dissipation, and he falls a victim to consumption. At his
death his wife was pregnant; she ascended the throne as the
Queen-regent, and looked after the affairs of state on behalf of
her unborn child. And here the story somewhat abruptly ends.
(2) THE SOUROES OF THE RAGHUVAMSA.
In ancient Sanskrit literature history in the modern sense of
the term is not to be found. It either merges in mythology or be--
comes for the most part indistinguishable from it; hence, although
the Raghuvamsa is based on historical material, the latter is so
slender that it can be disposed of in a few lines. Briefly summariz-
ed it amounts to this, that in the solar dynasty that ruled at
Ayodhya, there were four great kings, Dilips, Raghu, Aja and
Dasaratha; after these came Ráms, the greatest of all and the inear-
nation of divine Vishnu; after him came 24 kings, the last being
Agnivarna, who died without issue, leaving his queen enceinte.
The account of the solar race must have been a matter of common
knowledge in the times of Kálidâsa; but, with certain embellishments,
it had been already presented in narrative form by the authors
of the various Puránas, and in particular by Vâlmiki, the author
of the celebrated epic, Râmâyana. It is obvious that Kâlidása
was acquainted with this literature, and derived his
details from the same, choosing and discarding matter as suited
his purpose. Indeed he prominently mentions with deep reverence
the Rámáyaņa_and its author (cf. वृत्तं रामस्य वाल्मीकैः कृतिस्तौ
किंनरस्वनी । किं तद्येन मनो हर्तुमलं स्यातां न शृण्वताम् ॥ XV. 64), and
he has utilized it for the Râma-portion of his work. But the
Râmáyaṇa does not cover the whole ground of the Ragh.; and
Kâlidása has referred to certain other accounts of the solar"
