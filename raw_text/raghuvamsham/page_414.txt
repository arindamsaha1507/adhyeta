Pán. V. 4. 7. For a similar idea, cf. fara yfir:

:
S'1. 73. fa-thus. farfa:-respectfully addressed or informed.
N. B.-The verbs 37 and far are technical terms of addressing a
person, without any idea of actual command or request. Thus when a
person addresses one who is his superior in rank or dignity, the verb
fais used, while in the case of one addressing another who is inferior
in rank or dignity to him, is the verb used.
vaftafadz:-This indicates that the functions of all the
external senses were suspended. Cf. the description of the com-
templation of S'iva, in Kum. III. 48,
fag' &c.
Here is used to emphasizo ; a moment only. This
shows that Vasishtha was a master of yoga, who could put himself in
a comtemplative mood (ſ) in a moment, and set in operation
the inner apparatus for discovering unknown things.
Mark the use of the word which is deliberate.
This shows how scrupulous the poet is in selecting proper words
to express his similes. Vasishtha, who is the repository of harm-
less thoughts and actions, can with propriety be compared to a
having nothing in it but such harmless creatures as fish. With
this cf. VII. 30 where the prince looking pleased when really angry
are described as इदाः प्रसन्ना इव गूढनका:, where गूढमीन: would not
have suited.

means to steep, as a medicine, into a liquid that it should imbibe its
properties and be free from the inherent impuritios it is desired to be
cleared. Hence

therefore means one whose mind is purged of all impurities
forming its rust by its being imbued with spiritual knowledge by
constant meditation. See Pat. Yog. I. 30; Vod. Sar. 32 (Nir. Ed.)
एनं प्रत्यबोधयत् - The optional forms एनम् &c. of the pronouns इदम्
and ga are used when there is 3 or a subsequent assertion;
see Gr. 137. The first assertion hore is far a: Ha at g:
&c.; and then the second is introduced by अथ, अथैनं प्रत्यबोधयत् For
the aoc. g. see Sanj. and Gr. § 808."
