On account of his heavy grief Aja did not think of returning

परिवाह --( Also परी० ) the outflow of. qfare properly means 'a.
stream of water issuing through a sluice or the like when dammed
into a collection'. The poet means that Aja beheld, as it were, an
outflow of his own sorrow from the eyes of the women of the city
who were his co-sufferers in grief. See com.; cf. Kum. and Uttar.
quoted in the foot-note.
8. 75. ra affera: When the diksha or the initiatory
ceremony of a sacrifice is gone through, the sacrificer cannot
leave the place where the sacrifice is to be performed, until its
completion. He should remain in his seat every day at sunrise

at such a time and such an act on the part of the king would have
looked like a gross insult to the dignity of his Guru. This unto-
ward consequence the poet avoids by making the sage send his
pupil to the king instead of coming in person. - one's
