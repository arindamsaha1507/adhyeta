"(68)
[Canto VIII.
learnt (came to know) by means of abstract contemplation that he
(Aja) had been stunned by the great shock, exhorted him through
his pupil (disciple, who spoke) thus:-
76. Although the sage knows the cause of your grief, he has
not come personally to restore you to your natural state from which
you have fallen, since he has not (yet) finished the sacrifice.
77. O righteous (virtuous) king, his few words of advice (lit.
his speech containing a brief message) are entrusted to me (for
communication to you); hear them, O king, whose great mental
strength is well-known; you should please treasure them in your
heart.
78. The sage sees by his unobstructed eye of knowledge the
triad the past, the present and the future-in the three worlds
(lit. steps of the God who is without birth).
79. It is said that, informer times, Indra, afraid of Trinabindu
practising hard penance, sent (against) him the celestial woman.
(Apsaras), named Harinî, (able) to disturb his contemplation.
80. The sage, through rage which was caused by the obstacle
to his penance and which was a destructive wave to the shore of
his mental tranquillity, cursed her, who exhibited before him her
lovely amorous flirtations, in this (following) way:-"Be you a
woman on the earth."
81. "Revered sir, this person is entirely dependent on another;
(be pleased to) forgive my offensive conduct": when (she)
humbled (herself) in this way, he made her a denizen of the
earth until she saw heavenly flowers.
82. That (nymph), born in the family of the Krathakais ikas,,
became your queen, and having after a long time got the means
of the end of the curse, dropped down from the sky, died.
83. Enough then of thinking of her loss. Death falls to the lot
of all who are born. This earth should be protected by you;
for the Earth is the real wife of kings.
84. Avoiding the censure of being called arrogant when good
fortune smiled upon you, you showed by your self-possession
(the good effects of) your knowledge: now that mental pain has
be-fallen you, you should boldly show it again.
85. How can she be obtained by you (by) crying? She can-
not be obtained by you even by dying after her. The paths of
persons going to the other world are different (lit. in different
directions) according to their actions."
