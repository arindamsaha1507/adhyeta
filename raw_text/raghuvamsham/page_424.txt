[ Canto II.
-an appropriate simile. Since the word is fem. the
Upamá is faulty according to
and some other later
rhetoricians, but not so according to Vâmana, Daṇḍin and other
auciont writers. See ft.-note.
-
S1. 7. अन्तर्मदावस्थः - Here अन्त has the sense of अन्तर्गता.
According to a s'l. quoted by Vallabha, there are four species of
elephants of which the one referred to here is of the Bhadra kind.
fata: 1 One who drinks with two, scil. first with
the proboscis and then with the mouth; an elephant. - in compounds
like मनुजेन्द्र, नरेन्द्र & means a king and is added here to द्विप that
it should better compare with Dilipa, who was himself a Manuja-
indra. See ft.-note. द्विपानामिन्द्र उपचाराद्राजा द्विपेन्द्रः। द्विप इन्द्र इव द्विपेन्द्रः ।
उपमितसमासः | Pán. II. 1. 56; or द्विपेषु इन्द्रः |
Ś1. 8. Bargara &c.-This is a characteristic of the forester.
When one intends to enter a forest for hunting &c., he is described as
tying up his hair by means of tendrils or the like so that they may not
be entangled in thorns and brambles. Cf. IX. 51. Thus the tying up
of the hair being a sign (gu) of one about to enter a forest (ra)
the Sâtra quoted by Malli. applies.

अधिकृता ज्याश्य, ज्यामधिगतं वाधिज्यम्; मुनिहोमधेनुः - होमस्य धेनुः होमधेनुः |

होमधेनु: मुनिहोमधेनुः ।
Now the poet describes, in a poetical way of course, in s'lokas
9-13 (see Mallinâtha's introductory remark to these ) how the king was
received with usual formalities in the forest. When a monarch enters a
town, his servants run on both sides shouting Prosperity to the king;
here comes he,' &c.; this is done here by the trees (mark the mas. gender
of g that represents inales). As on such occasions the town-damsels throw
fried rice on the king and elderly ladies hurry to have a look at him,
so the young creepers strew flowers upon the king and the female deer
stand gazing upon him (10-11). Again songs in praise of the visitor are
sung everywhere in the town, and so the glory of the king is here sung
by the forest Dryads (12). Chauries are waved over him to remove
perspiration, and that is done here by the gentle breezes (13). And lastly,
as the royal visit is marked by some gracious act on the part of the
monarch, so is described in s'l. 14. the good done to the forest by the
presence of the king.
Ś1. 9. विसृष्टपार्श्वानुचरस्य - Cf. above ( 8 1. 4. ); पार्श्वयोरनुचराः पाश्र्व-
नुचराः । पर्शुनां समूहः पार्श्वम् | The word पार्श्व is derivod from पर्शु ( a con-
tracted form of qr) which means a rib-bone. q orqalso means
an axe, which sense it probably acquired from a sharp crooked rib -"
