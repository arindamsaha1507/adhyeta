II. KA'LIDA'SA.
(A) HIS LIFE, WORKS AND POETRY.
10×—
To turn now to the poet it must be admitted that we have absolute-
ly no trustworthy information regarding the personal
His Life history of Kálidâsa, by universal consent the great-
est of Indian poets. The curiosity of the querist who
would ask-'Where and when was he born?' 'Who were his parents ?'
"When did he die?' &c.-must ever remain unsatisfied. The poet
has studiously observed complete silence about himself in his works.
Read them howsoever we may, we find no allusion, no incident
mentioned, that may directly shed any light either on his personal
history or on any remarkable event of his life. Under these
circumstances we have to content ourselves with gathering what
little information we can about a poet of world-wide repute from
external sources, and a few incidents found here and there in his
works, which may be supposed to have a distant bearing upon the
history of his life. Reserving for another Section the question of
the date of the poet, we proceed here to state the few facts that can
thus be known about him. A time-honoured tradition, supported
by internal and external evidence, associates the name of Kâlidâsa
with that of the epoch-making king Vikramâditya of Ujjayinî.
The keen interest and admiration with which the poet describes the
Mahâkâla, the Siprâ, and other beauties of Ujjayinî, unmistakably
point to the conclusion that he must have been a native of that city.
And the various covert references to the name of Vikrama in fully
eulogistic terms, which are doubtless meant to immortalize king
Vikramâditya, are inexplicable if that monarch be not regarded as
the poet's patron. Kâlidâsa also betrays considerable acquaintance
with court-life in his works. This circumstance, coupled with the
fact that there is no allusion in his writings to the goddess of
wealth having ever frowned upon him, shows that he was in affluent
