(201)
-fr. 7A, to abandon, to leave; with 3 and aff ¾ (¤Ã); ª
complete leaving off of worldly objects; final emancipation (√¶¡¶¶1-
: Sid.-Kam). :—Here Kálidása uses the word af in the gene-
ral sense of the injunctions of the Vedas-those which enjoin the
performance of religious duties as well as those which enjoin their
renunciation with a view to obtain the knowledge of Brahman-and
not in its limited sense of yoìef:' (Jaimini I. 1. 2.). This
shows that Kálidása lived at a time anterior to that when the gulf
between the Purva and the Uttara Mîmámsás grew wider. See also
foot-notes.

rally at the end of a comp.
