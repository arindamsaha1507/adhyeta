These are according to the Puranas the original patriarchs of not
only mankind, but also of other species of creatures. Bhrgu is regarded
as the founder of the race of the Bhárgavas in which was born
Parashuráma. Vishnu while in his sleep of meditation is hymned
by the gods and sages; see foot-note. aarafa-Cf. Freitas

1. 16.
&c.-According to the Vedânta philosophy,
Nirguna Brahma or the Supreme Ens, without form and wholly
uubound and unaffected by any qualities, is the only really existing
entity. When it wishes to create the phenomenal world it assumes
the qualitiy of activity (Rajas) and becomes a male person as
Brahmá or the Creator; next in the progress of still further self-
evolution, it invests itself with the quality of goodness (or Satva )
and becomes Vishnu or the Preserver, and finally with the third
quality of foulness (or Tamas) appears as S'iva or the Destroyer.
Thus it is the one Saguna Brahman that assumes these three
characters. Cf. Kum. II. 4, 6 and Introd. to Ka'da. 1st sl.; se6
also foot-notes.
s1. 17. दिव्यं - दिवि भवं; . यत्. देशे देशे—the repetition shows
'variety'; in different places. r-Lit. abiding in; coming in
contact with.
-not affected by change or modification.
Brahman though associated with Satva &c. is itself unaffected by
any conditions or circumstances. cf. the S'ruti

the whole creation is his. अनर्थी - नास्ति अर्थ: यस्य one who has
nothing to seek. Cf. Gîtâ IV. 14 quoted in the foot-note. :-

Fथा take the affix स्नु in this sense, by ग्लाजिस्थश्च स्नु: | Pa'n. III.

passage quoted in the foot note, the meaning of is slightly
different; it means 'the Brahman ready to evolve the universe.'
