1. 35.o-The fate of some of the eastern kings served
as a warning to the Suhmas; it showed that Raghu was the ageat of
the g alone. :-The people of the Suhma country which was
situated to the west of Vanga. It was so called after Suhma, the
fourth son of Bali. Its capital af, also called
araft and arafft (see Hem. IV. 45) has been long identified with
the modern Tumlook, on the right bank of the Cossya (here called
Râpanarayana) which is the Kapis's of Kâlidâsa. In ancient times
it was situated closer to the sea than at present, and was a place
of considerable maritime trade. In the Máh. Bhâr, however,
Tâmralipta is mentioned as a separate country from Suhmades'a (See
Sabh. P. XXX. 24, 25), which, therefore, seems to have included wes-
tern Midnapur only. But in later times its extent was undoubtedly
greater, as Tâmralipta is mentioned by many writers as its capital.
According to the commentator of the Mahábhárata, the Suhmas were
also called Râdhas (Vide Sabh. P. XXX, 16), which is the name of
Western Bengal and from which the Rådhi Brâhmaṇas take their
name. It probably included Bardwån, (Vardhamâna) Bankoora
(Mallabhâmi), and Beerbhoom (Virabhâmi) as no separate mention is
made of these districts in early works. Vall. and Sum, explain
सु: as ब्रह्मदेशीयैः राजभिः वृत्तिम् - वर्तते अनयेति वृत्तिः; behaviour, the
action.aera-The Submas lived in a country abounding in the
cane-plants growing along the banks of the Ganges. Thus they
had every day an opportunity to see how big trees resisting the
force of the current were borne down by the river while the supple.
cane was spared, and to learn thereby the safest course of action in
case of an invasion by a more powerful enemy. The simile is
therefore appropriate in this respect. See ft.-note.
SI. 36.
-The kings of the Vanga country. See Sanj. on
:, and ft.-note. The country of Vanga or Eastern Bengal lay to
the west of Tipperah. It must not be confounded with Gauḍa ()
or Northern Bengal. In the Madhavachampâ the two countries are
clearly distinguished and Vanga is described to be that country
through which the Padma and the Brahmaputrá flow. And this will
be clear to us if we remember that the main channel of the Brahma.
putrâ originally flowed through Mymensing. The passage is impor-
tant inasmuch as it introduces the word Vanga, from which Bengal
is derived, and which is applied as a nickname by Calcutta people to
the people of Eastern Bengal. Kálidása here speaks of the branches
of the Ganges, so it seems that Vanga included the sea-coast of
Bengal. It is also called Samatata or plains. The word occurs in"
