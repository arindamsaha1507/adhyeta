moon. Cf. the epithets Famary &c. cfaar jaat qa.--The Chakraváka
bird. "The males and females of these birds are found to keep
together during day, and are, like the turtle-dove, patterns of con-
stancy and connubial affection." M.-Williams. It is an anachronism,
according to some commentators, to make Aja allude to the separation
of the chakraváka birds. For it is the curse pronounced by Ráma
that parts the male Chakraváka from the female during the whole
night. While Ráma was mourning the loss of his belovod, Sîtá,
sitting on the bank of the lake Pampá the chakraváka birds laughed
at him, whereupon he condemned them to perpetual separation du-
ring nights. FrrIT-See Malli.; it rather means the interval of
the separation. This Viraha of the pair is often alluded to in Sanskrit
literature.
-Gone to return no more. Since there is no
returning, the separation is final and not for an interval; hence
his grief.
