Who could be disarmed even by children; i. e. who are in a helpless
condition.
Because according to the A'ryan notion
it is a sin for a married woman to look at the face of any other
male than her husband. When expressly permitted by her husband

(see Ś1. 33), the sense would not suit the context. Malli. himself
sees the difficulty and takes उदवहत् in the secondary sense of आत्म-
made his own,' now that the opposing kings were defeated-&
