[Canto VI.
64. Be pleased ever to amuse yourself in the sites of the Ma-
Taya mountain, where the areca-palms have the betel-nut creepers
twining round them, where the sandal trees are encircled by the
cardamom creepers, and where the ground is overspread with
Tamâla leaves.
65. This prince has a bodily frame as dark as the blue lotus,
while your slender form rivals in fairness the gorochana' (a yel-

when it has once reached the Sahakára (mango) tree in full
blossom.

70. Having observed that Indumatî, bright as the moon, had
her heart riveted upon him, Sunandá, who was versed in the
art of giving a well-arranged account, delivered the following
speech in detail.
71. There lived a mouarch, of the I'kshvâku race, the most
eminent of kings, who was distinguished by the title of Kakutshia
(or, after Malli, Kakutsta by name and renowned for his virtues).
It is from him that the lords of the Northern Kosalas, of high
aspirations, bear the proud patronymic of Kákutshta.
